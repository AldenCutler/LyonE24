Two days later, on Saturday morning, I arose, a tottering wreck, and went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend, the Rev. Mr.------, to walk to the Talcott Tower, ten miles distant. He stared at me, but asked no questions. We started. Mr.------ talked, talked, talked as is his wont. I said nothing; I heard nothing. At the end of a mile, Mr.------ said ""Mark, are you sick? I never saw a man look so haggard and worn and absent-minded. Say something, do!""

Drearily, without enthusiasm, I said: ""Punch brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!""

My friend eyed me blankly, looked perplexed, they said:

""I do not think I get your drift, Mark. Then does not seem to be any relevancy in what you have said, certainly nothing sad; and yet--maybe it was the way you said the words--I never heard anything that sounded so pathetic. What is--""

But I heard no more. I was already far away with my pitiless, heartbreaking ""blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, pink trip slip for a three-cent fare; punch in the presence of the passenjare."" I do not know what occurred during the other nine miles. However, all of a sudden Mr.------ laid his hand on my shoulder and shouted:

""Oh, wake up! wake up! wake up! Don't sleep all day! Here we are at the Tower, man! I have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind, and never got a response. Just look at this magnificent autumn landscape! Look at it! look at it! Feast your eye on it! You have traveled; you have seen boaster landscapes elsewhere. Come, now, deliver an honest opinion. What do you say to this?""

I sighed wearily; and murmured:

""A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare, punch in the presence of the passenjare.""

Rev. Mr. ------ stood there, very grave, full of concern, apparently, and looked long at me; then he said:

""Mark, there is something about this that I cannot understand. Those are about the same words you said before; there does not seem to be anything in them, and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them. Punch in the--how is it they go?""

I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines.

My friend's face lighted with interest. He said:

""Why, what a captivating jingle it is! It is almost music. It flows along so nicely. I have nearly caught the rhymes myself. Say them over just once more, and then I'll have them, sure.""

I said them over. Then Mr. ------ said them. He made one little mistake, which I corrected. The next time and the next he got them right. Now a great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders. That torturing jingle departed out of my brain, and a grateful sense of rest and peace descended upon me. I was light-hearted enough to sing; and I did sing for half an hour, straight along, as we went jogging homeward. Then my freed tongue found blessed speech again, and the pent talk of many a weary hour began to gush and flow. It flowed on and on, joyously, jubilantly, until the fountain was empty and dry. As I wrung my friend's hand at parting, I said:

""Haven't we had a royal good time! But now I remember, you haven't said a word for two hours. Come, come, out with something!""

The Rev. Mr.------ turned a lack-luster eye upon me, drew a deep sigh, and said, without animation, without apparent consciousness:

""Punch, brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!"" 

A pang shot through me as I said to myself, ""Poor fellow, poor fellow! he has got it, now.""

I did not see Mr.------ for two or three days after that. Then, on Tuesday evening, he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into a seat. He was pale, worn; he was a wreck. He lifted his faded eyes to my face and said:

""Ah, Mark, it was a ruinous investment that I made in those heartless rhymes. They have ridden me like a nightmare, day and night, hour after hour, to this very moment. Since I saw you I have suffered the torments of the lost. Saturday evening I had a sudden call, by telegraph, and took the night train for Boston. The occasion was the death of a valued old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon. I took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse. But I never got beyond the opening paragraph; for then the train started and the car-wheels began their 'clack, clack-clack-clack-clack! clack-clack! --clack-clack-clack!' and right away those odious rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment. For an hour I sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the car-wheels made. Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had been chopping wood all day. My skull was splitting with headache. It seemed to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and went to bed. I stretched myself out in my berth, and--well, you know what the result was. The thing went right along, just the same. 'Clack-clack clack, a blue trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight cent fare; clack-clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack clack-clack, for a six-cent fare, and so on, and so on, and so on punch in the presence of the passenjare!' Sleep? Not a single wink! I was almost a lunatic when I got to Boston. Don't ask me about the funeral. I did the best I could, but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and out with 'Punch, brothers, punch with care, punch in the presence of the passenjare.' And the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes, and I could actually catch absent-minded people nodding time to the swing of it with their stupid heads. And, Mark, you may believe it or not, but before I got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn unison, mourners, undertaker, and all. The moment I had finished, I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy. Of course it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there, who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into the church. She began to sob, and said:

""'Oh, oh, he is gone, he is gone, and I didn't see him before he died!'

""'Yes!' I said, 'he is gone, he is gone, he is gone--oh, will this suffering never cease!'

""'You loved him, then! Oh, you too loved him!'

""'Loved him! Loved who?'

""'Why, my poor George! my poor nephew!'

""'Oh--him! Yes--oh, yes, yes. Certainly--certainly. Punch--punch--oh, this misery will kill me!'

""'Bless you! bless you, sir, for these sweet words! I, too, suffer in this dear loss. Were you present during his last moments?'

""'Yes. I--whose last moments?'

""'His. The dear departed's.'

""'Yes! Oh, yes--yes--yes! I suppose so, I think so, I don't know! Oh, certainly--I was there I was there!'

""'Oh, what a privilege! what a precious privilege! And his last words --oh, tell me, tell me his last words! What did he say?'

""'He said--he said--oh, my head, my head, my head! He said--he said--he never said anything but Punch, punch, punch in the presence of the passenjare! Oh, leave me, madam! In the name of all that is generous, leave me to my madness, my misery, my despair!--a buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare--endu--rance can no fur--ther go!--PUNCH in the presence of the passenjare!""

My friend's hopeless eyes rested upon mine a pregnant minute, and then he said impressively:

""Mark, you do not say anything. You do not offer me any hope. But, ah me, it is just as well--it is just as well. You could not do me any good. The time has long gone by when words could comfort me. Something tells me that my tongue is doomed to wag forever to the jigger of that remorseless jingle. There--there it is coming on me again: a blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip for a--""

Thus murmuring faint and fainter, my friend sank into a peaceful trance and forgot his sufferings in a blessed respite.

How did I finally save him from an asylum? I took him to a neighboring university and made him discharge the burden of his persecuting rhymes into the eager ears of the poor, unthinking students. How is it with them, now? The result is too sad to tell. Why did I write this article? It was for a worthy, even a noble, purpose. It was to warn you, reader, if you should came across those merciless rhymes, to avoid them--avoid them as you would a pestilence."

Few more years later, in NYC again, coming out of Wall Street Station to visit a mate who works nearby, remembering about Mikey on the platform. No where to be scene this day.

I went to one of my best friend's birthday parties in NYC and met a friend of her's who I've heard much about but never met up until then. It was a very small group of 5 people and my best friend and two others were talking over dinner about things I hadn't been to (I've spent alot of time away from NY with school, etc) so I couldn't be involved in the conversation. The guy, had served in the military for the past few years so also could not contribute to their convo. He and I ended up talking and hitting it off, so we exchanged numbers. Later that night on our way back to my best friend's house, we were in the subway and I was a little drunk. My friend had noticed he was texting me and then started going through every single one of my past relationships telling me exactly what I did wrong and what my problems were. Needless to say, I was really hurt by this because previously she'd explained she only had a crush on him back in elementary school (she's in her late 20's now). But when we got back to her house, she said she didn't care if we hung out or whatever so I thought things were ok. But when I woke up, she said she had changed her mind and it wasn't ok for us to hang out. Things just got really awkward from there.

Long story short, he and I liked each other and ended up hanging out and eventually sleeping together. Shortly after he went off to London for grad school and things did fizzle out. It was fun while it lasted. My friend, on the other hand, hasn't spoken to me since then, save a few exchanged emails. If there was more than just a crush she could have explained that to me, but I didn't see the big deal. If they had dated I would have stayed away but IMO I didn't do anything wrong. I tried many many times to get in touch with her to talk things out but to no avail. If she really valued our friendship she would talk to me and work it out. But I guess it's just one of those moments when you realize who really is your friend... 

As with your situation, it's possible that she may never forgive you, especially if she's obsessed over him. Just take space for awhile, don't badger her into talking to you or forgiving you etc. Do your own thing and if she really values your friendship, I believe she will come around."

Never the less, (probably because I am the aforementioned ""dick"" / ""jackass"")  I I'll try one last time, then you can call me a Nazi and Godwin's law will save me from further comments.

Here is my argument in simple economic terms (which in a subject as emotional as loving your children, will surely fail to convince anyone and get me downvoted - AGAIN).

If before you have kids you have the money / opportunity / ability / time to do lots of things that make you very ""happy"" (whatever they are -- travel, build a business, eat out, work for politcal change, get drunk, feed the homeless, play board games, spend 80 hours a week researching a cure for cancer, train for a marathon, paint, learn farsi - whatever) you are accumulating LOTS of benefits.

If, after you have kids you can no longer do some protion (ar any portion) of these things the the cost of having children is very high it offsets enourmous benefits. Of course it provides benefits as well, but this doesn't change the high costs.

On the other hand, if before you had kids you were not able to do as many (or perhaps very few things) that made you very ""happy"", when you have kids the cost is lower, (you didn't have to give up as much). You got the same (or perhaps even greater) benefits from having kids but at a lower cost.

So now I become the jack ass / dick  again...

If you have a great life:

 * love
 * friends
 * plenty of money
 * work you care about
 * a creative outlet
 * a sense that what you are doing is meaningful and important

Having kids is probably harder on you than if you had a less great life...

 * love
 * friends
 * some money -- but not so much that you can spend it without thinking
 * a job you don't much like
 * no creative outlet
 * sense that what you are doing really matters in the world.

In life two having a kid not only comes at a lower cost (you had less to give up) it may provide some additional benefits, life now seems to have a greater purpose, the work you do (caring for your child) is work you care about etc. 

Let the comparisons to Hitler begin."

The guy interrupts saying ""at least let me show you what I can do"". So they take him up in the bell tower, where he backs up, takes a run at the bell, bong, face first. He backs up again, takes a run at the bell, bong, again. Again, he backs up, takes a run at the bell, misses, falls out of the bell tower to the pavement below, he's dead.

The cops come, take pictures, ask questions, etc. They show a picture to one of the monks and ask ""Do you recognize the victim?"" They monk looks at the picture and says ""No, but his face rings a bell"". Wait... wait... there's more.

But just realise that you can always ask if you get lost or in trouble. Most stuff is signed in English as well as Jap in Tokyo. Tokyo doesn't have much of a language barrier. If you try to speak basic jap (like please/thank you/where is~) they'll fall over themselves to help you, and most people (esp younger) have some kind of English.   
As for transportation... well Tokyo subway system is much like an overturned bowl of noodles - covering 3 different companies requiring 3 different tickets. Best to ask if you need to use it.  
 The train system however, is your friend - the JR loop line circles most of the touristy stuff and is very easy to navigate. You can get day tickets to save on money (Jap rail pays by number of stations travelled, not by time). Most maps of streets will only show the major streets so get used to asking where things are.   
Get out and live in Tokyo. It's an awesome place. It can be expensive, but there's a lot you can do with minimal funds. One place I recommend is Kappa Bashi Dori - it sells the awesomely realistic fake food. Also, the Imperial Palace, Ghibli Museum, Ginza at night, Shibuya, and Harajuku.

That ultimately depends on you--do you want to stay in hostels, guesthouses, or budget hotels, or fancy rooms?   Japanese hostels tend to be farther out of the center of the city, but that's no big deal for someone who enjoys learning the public transportation systems (myself included!).  All in all, expect about what you would pay if you were to visit Paris or Rome on a budget.

&gt; It would also involve a lot more forward planning as I would have to book time off way in advance.

I completely understand but I must say ""that's too bad.""  FWIW, things aren't always cheaper when you book in advance.   Planes, maybe, but I have had success finding cheap tickets three days before the flight.

As an American who's lived outside SF, I must say it's a very enjoyable city but for some reason I can't place it on the level of ""awesomeness"" that you experience in the east.  I've been to Montreal, once for a short time, but can't say I'd ever want to go back.  I'm going to come off as a prick when I say this, probably, but Canada and the US (particularly SF) aren't so different culturally.

&gt; They stayed with a host family. I was thinking of trying this route, but it sounds pretty scary.

DO THIS!   I cannot stress this enough.  I stayed with a host family in London and loved it.  I wish I knew more people / had more connections to find some more host families.   If you don't stay with a host family I really hope you stay in a place where there's a communal area with other travelers so you can talk to and meet others.  What are you scared of?  Dying?  Surely you'll be more likely to be knifed in Glasgow.

&gt; How do you cope financially with such long trips? I wish I could win the lotto and just get away!

Budget.  Yes, I saved up for several years (and didn't buy girls fancy schmancies).  If you want to travel indefinitely, the pay for native English teachers out here is quite good (2000USD/mo, IIRC).

But no, in general it doesn't bother me. 

Also ( I used to run a central London nightclub and went on an anti-terrorism lecture by the Met Police and the bomb squad... FTR absolutely fascinating stuff) If this does happen and you get a strong odour of marzipan, almond or peroxide... get the fuck out of there. "

The view as you cross the river is spectacular. 

Also the Saturday market on Portobello road is pretty special, get the tube to Notting hill and ask somebody which way, then walk from the top all the way down to Ladbroke grove, it's a few miles, but if you really want to see some of London it's worth the journey. 

By all means go to Oxford street and Piccadilly circus, but quite frankly, it's just a tourist trap. 

I'd join you for coffee, but unfortunately I'm working the weekend. "
