Two days later, on Saturday morning, I arose, a tottering wreck, and went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend, the Rev. Mr.------, to walk to the Talcott Tower, ten miles distant. He stared at me, but asked no questions. We started. Mr.------ talked, talked, talked as is his wont. I said nothing; I heard nothing. At the end of a mile, Mr.------ said ""Mark, are you sick? I never saw a man look so haggard and worn and absent-minded. Say something, do!""

Drearily, without enthusiasm, I said: ""Punch brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!""

My friend eyed me blankly, looked perplexed, they said:

""I do not think I get your drift, Mark. Then does not seem to be any relevancy in what you have said, certainly nothing sad; and yet--maybe it was the way you said the words--I never heard anything that sounded so pathetic. What is--""

But I heard no more. I was already far away with my pitiless, heartbreaking ""blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, pink trip slip for a three-cent fare; punch in the presence of the passenjare."" I do not know what occurred during the other nine miles. However, all of a sudden Mr.------ laid his hand on my shoulder and shouted:

""Oh, wake up! wake up! wake up! Don't sleep all day! Here we are at the Tower, man! I have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind, and never got a response. Just look at this magnificent autumn landscape! Look at it! look at it! Feast your eye on it! You have traveled; you have seen boaster landscapes elsewhere. Come, now, deliver an honest opinion. What do you say to this?""

I sighed wearily; and murmured:

""A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare, punch in the presence of the passenjare.""

Rev. Mr. ------ stood there, very grave, full of concern, apparently, and looked long at me; then he said:

""Mark, there is something about this that I cannot understand. Those are about the same words you said before; there does not seem to be anything in them, and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them. Punch in the--how is it they go?""

I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines.

My friend's face lighted with interest. He said:

""Why, what a captivating jingle it is! It is almost music. It flows along so nicely. I have nearly caught the rhymes myself. Say them over just once more, and then I'll have them, sure.""

I said them over. Then Mr. ------ said them. He made one little mistake, which I corrected. The next time and the next he got them right. Now a great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders. That torturing jingle departed out of my brain, and a grateful sense of rest and peace descended upon me. I was light-hearted enough to sing; and I did sing for half an hour, straight along, as we went jogging homeward. Then my freed tongue found blessed speech again, and the pent talk of many a weary hour began to gush and flow. It flowed on and on, joyously, jubilantly, until the fountain was empty and dry. As I wrung my friend's hand at parting, I said:

""Haven't we had a royal good time! But now I remember, you haven't said a word for two hours. Come, come, out with something!""

The Rev. Mr.------ turned a lack-luster eye upon me, drew a deep sigh, and said, without animation, without apparent consciousness:

""Punch, brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!"" 

A pang shot through me as I said to myself, ""Poor fellow, poor fellow! he has got it, now.""

I did not see Mr.------ for two or three days after that. Then, on Tuesday evening, he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into a seat. He was pale, worn; he was a wreck. He lifted his faded eyes to my face and said:

""Ah, Mark, it was a ruinous investment that I made in those heartless rhymes. They have ridden me like a nightmare, day and night, hour after hour, to this very moment. Since I saw you I have suffered the torments of the lost. Saturday evening I had a sudden call, by telegraph, and took the night train for Boston. The occasion was the death of a valued old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon. I took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse. But I never got beyond the opening paragraph; for then the train started and the car-wheels began their 'clack, clack-clack-clack-clack! clack-clack! --clack-clack-clack!' and right away those odious rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment. For an hour I sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the car-wheels made. Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had been chopping wood all day. My skull was splitting with headache. It seemed to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and went to bed. I stretched myself out in my berth, and--well, you know what the result was. The thing went right along, just the same. 'Clack-clack clack, a blue trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight cent fare; clack-clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack clack-clack, for a six-cent fare, and so on, and so on, and so on punch in the presence of the passenjare!' Sleep? Not a single wink! I was almost a lunatic when I got to Boston. Don't ask me about the funeral. I did the best I could, but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and out with 'Punch, brothers, punch with care, punch in the presence of the passenjare.' And the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes, and I could actually catch absent-minded people nodding time to the swing of it with their stupid heads. And, Mark, you may believe it or not, but before I got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn unison, mourners, undertaker, and all. The moment I had finished, I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy. Of course it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there, who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into the church. She began to sob, and said:

""'Oh, oh, he is gone, he is gone, and I didn't see him before he died!'

""'Yes!' I said, 'he is gone, he is gone, he is gone--oh, will this suffering never cease!'

""'You loved him, then! Oh, you too loved him!'

""'Loved him! Loved who?'

""'Why, my poor George! my poor nephew!'

""'Oh--him! Yes--oh, yes, yes. Certainly--certainly. Punch--punch--oh, this misery will kill me!'

""'Bless you! bless you, sir, for these sweet words! I, too, suffer in this dear loss. Were you present during his last moments?'

""'Yes. I--whose last moments?'

""'His. The dear departed's.'

""'Yes! Oh, yes--yes--yes! I suppose so, I think so, I don't know! Oh, certainly--I was there I was there!'

""'Oh, what a privilege! what a precious privilege! And his last words --oh, tell me, tell me his last words! What did he say?'

""'He said--he said--oh, my head, my head, my head! He said--he said--he never said anything but Punch, punch, punch in the presence of the passenjare! Oh, leave me, madam! In the name of all that is generous, leave me to my madness, my misery, my despair!--a buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare--endu--rance can no fur--ther go!--PUNCH in the presence of the passenjare!""

My friend's hopeless eyes rested upon mine a pregnant minute, and then he said impressively:

""Mark, you do not say anything. You do not offer me any hope. But, ah me, it is just as well--it is just as well. You could not do me any good. The time has long gone by when words could comfort me. Something tells me that my tongue is doomed to wag forever to the jigger of that remorseless jingle. There--there it is coming on me again: a blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip for a--""

Thus murmuring faint and fainter, my friend sank into a peaceful trance and forgot his sufferings in a blessed respite.

How did I finally save him from an asylum? I took him to a neighboring university and made him discharge the burden of his persecuting rhymes into the eager ears of the poor, unthinking students. How is it with them, now? The result is too sad to tell. Why did I write this article? It was for a worthy, even a noble, purpose. It was to warn you, reader, if you should came across those merciless rhymes, to avoid them--avoid them as you would a pestilence."

I went to one of my best friend's birthday parties in NYC and met a friend of her's who I've heard much about but never met up until then. It was a very small group of 5 people and my best friend and two others were talking over dinner about things I hadn't been to (I've spent alot of time away from NY with school, etc) so I couldn't be involved in the conversation. The guy, had served in the military for the past few years so also could not contribute to their convo. He and I ended up talking and hitting it off, so we exchanged numbers. Later that night on our way back to my best friend's house, we were in the subway and I was a little drunk. My friend had noticed he was texting me and then started going through every single one of my past relationships telling me exactly what I did wrong and what my problems were. Needless to say, I was really hurt by this because previously she'd explained she only had a crush on him back in elementary school (she's in her late 20's now). But when we got back to her house, she said she didn't care if we hung out or whatever so I thought things were ok. But when I woke up, she said she had changed her mind and it wasn't ok for us to hang out. Things just got really awkward from there.

Long story short, he and I liked each other and ended up hanging out and eventually sleeping together. Shortly after he went off to London for grad school and things did fizzle out. It was fun while it lasted. My friend, on the other hand, hasn't spoken to me since then, save a few exchanged emails. If there was more than just a crush she could have explained that to me, but I didn't see the big deal. If they had dated I would have stayed away but IMO I didn't do anything wrong. I tried many many times to get in touch with her to talk things out but to no avail. If she really valued our friendship she would talk to me and work it out. But I guess it's just one of those moments when you realize who really is your friend... 

As with your situation, it's possible that she may never forgive you, especially if she's obsessed over him. Just take space for awhile, don't badger her into talking to you or forgiving you etc. Do your own thing and if she really values your friendship, I believe she will come around."

Never the less, (probably because I am the aforementioned ""dick"" / ""jackass"")  I I'll try one last time, then you can call me a Nazi and Godwin's law will save me from further comments.

Here is my argument in simple economic terms (which in a subject as emotional as loving your children, will surely fail to convince anyone and get me downvoted - AGAIN).

If before you have kids you have the money / opportunity / ability / time to do lots of things that make you very ""happy"" (whatever they are -- travel, build a business, eat out, work for politcal change, get drunk, feed the homeless, play board games, spend 80 hours a week researching a cure for cancer, train for a marathon, paint, learn farsi - whatever) you are accumulating LOTS of benefits.

If, after you have kids you can no longer do some protion (ar any portion) of these things the the cost of having children is very high it offsets enourmous benefits. Of course it provides benefits as well, but this doesn't change the high costs.

On the other hand, if before you had kids you were not able to do as many (or perhaps very few things) that made you very ""happy"", when you have kids the cost is lower, (you didn't have to give up as much). You got the same (or perhaps even greater) benefits from having kids but at a lower cost.

So now I become the jack ass / dick  again...

If you have a great life:

 * love
 * friends
 * plenty of money
 * work you care about
 * a creative outlet
 * a sense that what you are doing is meaningful and important

Having kids is probably harder on you than if you had a less great life...

 * love
 * friends
 * some money -- but not so much that you can spend it without thinking
 * a job you don't much like
 * no creative outlet
 * sense that what you are doing really matters in the world.

In life two having a kid not only comes at a lower cost (you had less to give up) it may provide some additional benefits, life now seems to have a greater purpose, the work you do (caring for your child) is work you care about etc. 

Let the comparisons to Hitler begin."

He backs up again, takes a run at the bell, bong, again. Again, he backs up, takes a run at the bell, misses, falls out of the bell tower to the pavement below, he's dead.

The cops come, take pictures, ask questions, etc. They show a picture to one of the monks and ask ""Do you recognize the victim?"" They monk looks at the picture and says ""No, but his face rings a bell"". Wait... wait... there's more.

But just realise that you can always ask if you get lost or in trouble. Most stuff is signed in English as well as Jap in Tokyo. Tokyo doesn't have much of a language barrier. If you try to speak basic jap (like please/thank you/where is~) they'll fall over themselves to help you, and most people (esp younger) have some kind of English.   
As for transportation... well Tokyo subway system is much like an overturned bowl of noodles - covering 3 different companies requiring 3 different tickets. Best to ask if you need to use it.  
 The train system however, is your friend - the JR loop line circles most of the touristy stuff and is very easy to navigate. You can get day tickets to save on money (Jap rail pays by number of stations travelled, not by time). Most maps of streets will only show the major streets so get used to asking where things are.   
Get out and live in Tokyo. It's an awesome place. It can be expensive, but there's a lot you can do with minimal funds. One place I recommend is Kappa Bashi Dori - it sells the awesomely realistic fake food. Also, the Imperial Palace, Ghibli Museum, Ginza at night, Shibuya, and Harajuku.

t3_bllaa,AskReddit,1,0,1,POSITIVE,0.5829975008964539,"&gt; Hey thanks for the reply. I guess the most appropriate question given your advice is how expensive Japan is?

That ultimately depends on you--do you want to stay in hostels, guesthouses, or budget hotels, or fancy rooms?   Japanese hostels tend to be farther out of the center of the city, but that's no big deal for someone who enjoys learning the public transportation systems (myself included!).  All in all, expect about what you would pay if you were to visit Paris or Rome on a budget.

&gt; It would also involve a lot more forward planning as I would have to book time off way in advance.

I completely understand but I must say ""that's too bad.""  FWIW, things aren't always cheaper when you book in advance.   Planes, maybe, but I have had success finding cheap tickets three days before the flight.

As an American who's lived outside SF, I must say it's a very enjoyable city but for some reason I can't place it on the level of ""awesomeness"" that you experience in the east.  I've been to Montreal, once for a short time, but can't say I'd ever want to go back.  I'm going to come off as a prick when I say this, probably, but Canada and the US (particularly SF) aren't so different culturally.

&gt; They stayed with a host family. I was thinking of trying this route, but it sounds pretty scary.

DO THIS!   I cannot stress this enough.  I stayed with a host family in London and loved it.  I wish I knew more people / had more connections to find some more host families.   If you don't stay with a host family I really hope you stay in a place where there's a communal area with other travelers so you can talk to and meet others.  What are you scared of?  Dying?  Surely you'll be more likely to be knifed in Glasgow.

&gt; How do you cope financially with such long trips? I wish I could win the lotto and just get away!

Budget.  Yes, I saved up for several years (and didn't buy girls fancy schmancies).  If you want to travel indefinitely, the pay for native English teachers out here is quite good (2000USD/mo, IIRC).

A large area of land is under the USAF's landing/take-off approach to Luke AFB.  The agreement prevents the construction of new single family homes, which in my opinion, is great.  The west valley has a tremendous amount of homes, constructed, being constructed, and planned.  What we need is employment.  Hopefully, with the introduction of the F-35, the West Valley of the Phoenix metro can position itself to capture the ancillary benefits of the new fighter jet technology.  The noise will be something to contend with, but R&amp;D, manufacturing, logisitics, and other large-scale, non-residential uses could be perfect for these flight path areas.  These uses are net tax positive for the communities and will allow them to provide enhanced services to their residences.

If I could make a comparison, some communities impacted greatly by Luke AFB should take a lesson from Rosemont, IL.  In the shadow of a busy approach to O'hare airport, Rosemont has capitalized on hospitality, entertainment, industry, and other non-residential uses to support it's residential services.  The agreement is anything but detrimental.  The key is for the leaders and planners of the West Valley to recognize that proper land planning can produce incredible returns for the existing and future residences."

I'll give you some tips that I found useful:

- Don't take too much clothes. You're going to have to carry around a big-ass backpack, and it's basically all clothing. Every city has laundromats, or even the hostels will have laundry.

- About the hostels: have everything booked already from your country of origin. I spent one night ""sleeping"" on the streets of Amsterdam and it wasn't pretty.

- Always have one of [these](http://coolrain44.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/purell-hand-sanitizer.jpg). I found it very useful.

- Regardng the places you shouldn't miss: it depends on the countries you are planning to visit. I went to Blois, Toulouse, Paris, Orleans, Bruges, Brussels, Amsterdam... and a couple more cities I can't remember right now. If you're planning on going to any of those countries (France, Belgium, Holland) be sure to visit the places I mentioned.

- When you get to a city, if you have a hostel booked, go there first and leave your stuff. If not, leave it in the luggage lockers you'll find in every train station and rent bikes. Every major city has bike rentals next to the trains stations and the city itself has a bike lane. It's a fast and fun(and cheap) way to see the city.

Can't think of anything else. Hope it helps.

t3_blb5f,pics,2,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9788377285003662,":) your post made me smile. I'm also a traceur (of around 3 years I think). I took a break for around half a year due to lack of motivation, but started conditioning again. I was fortunate enough to train with a couple guys from the Yamakasi in Brighton a while back. It was brilliant, they gave me such perspective on everything we do. They told us of the show-offs in Paris doing to impress girls, and the increased likelihood of the injuries they get, and they made me tremble with fear at the size of them perfectly-honed bodies.

This footage for me underscores exactly what is wrong with parkour in the media. Obviously the 'true' nature of parkour doesn't get enough limelight because let's face it, drilling a cat pass for an hour does not good TV make. 'Crazy', 'extreme' stuff like this and Bell's Man Power gap do.

To people who are maybe just discovering parkour, or are even slightly interested, please read a little into it before you tell someone else what you think parkour is. I hate to sound snobby and elitist but if you watch the mass-media you are probably not quite clear on what exactly parkour is. Watch the interviews with David Belle on youtube, watch videos by people like Blane, Stephane Vigroux, maybe the Cambridge parkour lot. Parkour is not doing flips and spinz'n'shit and looking fancy, it is pure, efficient movement. It is conditioning your body to move here to there as if your life depended on it. To be fair, David Belle does a pretty good job of showing its true nature in District 13.

As for people who seem to think it's dangerous; it's only dangerous if you attempt stuff your body isn't ready for. The people you see doing parkour (or freerunning for that matter) on TV have often been practising for years and the danger aspect, while not 0, is substantially reduced. You wouldn't attempt to put your fist through some bricks after doing martial arts training for a day. And if you do, you only have yourself to blame."
t3_bgguv,seduction,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9838374257087708,"DHVing and qualifying are the same in the sense that in both cases you are trying to convince the girl you have higher value. the difference lies in how you go about it.

When DHVing it's like your 'accidentally' letting a girl know you have higher value, so you are not trying to impress her, but yet she is impressed. When you qualify your self to a girl, it is obvious you are trying to impress her. An example:

Qualifying yourself: I drive an Austin Martin DB Vanquish. Paid 80 grand for it. It's the same model as from the latest James Bond film. Oh, and by the way I date models.

DHVing: A funny thing happened to me the other week. I had just come back on the tube from the London fashion show, I'd been there supporting this girl I had been seeing at the time who was modeling there. Anyway, when I get home my car isn't in the drive. Now this really terrified me, because it's an Austin Martin DB vanquish, and I saw on crimewatch on TV the week before that because they're quite rare (I think it was the car James Bond drives in one of the films) this make and model of car is on a list of cars that are known to be stolen to order in the UK and shipped abroad. I called the police and everything. They came round, and just as they were taking my statement, my brother pulls up in the car. He lives out of town, and had popped by unannounced on a surprise visit. He has keys to my house, and when he realised I wasn't there he decided to borrow my car and take it for a spin. The police weren't impressed, and we had to spend 10 minutes convincing them not to press charges.

The qualification is obviously trying to impress the girl. The DHV communicates all the same basic information as the qualification (I drive expensive cars and date hot women, which is wealth and pre selection which are both value attributes), but this information is presented differently. With the DHV, you are just telling a funny story, you are not trying to impress her by telling her about the car and the model gf.

The key is that if she thinks you are trying to impress her, this is a demonstration of lower value, because if you feel the need to impress her by qualifying yourself to her, you must feel that she is of higher value than you.

People also seem to use qualifying to mean being defensive, like explaining your actions to her when prompted.

Please note that I'm still quite new to this, so this might not be quite right!"
t3_blube,AskReddit,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9471210837364197,"I don't know if you will ever see this nor have i read all the posts, but I'll tell you how it is for a 23 year old urban white male- I live in NYC. I never use the word nigger, nigga, negro, or the ""n-word"" for a number of reasons. First, it doesn't fit into my vocabulary. I'm no professional dude, but i could find a lot of other words to describe a black person or african american then the words previously mentioned. That is, if i even need to point out that the person is black. Second, When I hear words that make me feel uncomfortable, I don't even bother listening anymore. I don't want that happening to me. Therefore, i avoid confrontational words. If someone needs to use that word then they aren't worth listening to, especially if they're a lawyer.
You can tell a lot about someone by listening to their choice of words. 

I'm also a little annoyed at the double standard we have with language. Black people can say the ""n-word"" but white people can't? By doing so the word is put on a pedestal, making it more attractive. This applies to other races and ""their words"" as well. White people don't get angry at the word cracker, nor do they lay claim to the word. And subsequently you don't see it being used as a derogatory word. I'm not trying to save the world here, it's just a point. 

If you haven't noticed, i refer to african americans as either black or african american. It's what *I'am* comfortable with, because *i* don't care what race you are. I only recognize two races- asshole and not asshole. If you're not an asshole i like you, and if you're an asshole i don't like you. Simple as that.

The best advice i could give you when hearing someone use nigger, nigga, negro, or any other variation of the n-word is to just tell yourself that he or she is not worth listening to; that his or her words are worth exactly two cents. It's a word unlike every other that is based on so much hate, anyone who doesn't recognize it as such is a retard.

Bennett wanted a fully publicly funded stadium built in downtown Seattle and he wanted it in a year.

--Shopkeepers often 'forget' to give a fiver back when an American makes a purchase.
  Yes, it is cruel, but Americans rather ask for it by being incapable of thinking in anything other than dollars. 

--I'm stupid because I don't understand references to shows on the telly such as Don't Forget Your Toothbrush and The Magic Roundabout.
  Oh come on, everyone has their own culture.  Oops, my mistake, you are American.

--6 hours of sheep dog trials from New Zealand is not entertaining television.
  Ok, so you picked a bad night.  But think about it for a moment.  6hrs of actual program content is far more than you get on most US TV in a week's worth of viewing time.

--England did not win WWII with 'a bit' of American help.
  Oh dear, an American favourite.  The war in Europe was won before the US even arrived.
  How so ?  Stalingrad.  The Nazis never lost a battle before Stalingrad and never won one after.  The battle of Stalingrad destroyed the German army. They never could recover.
  Of course, the US did supply a lot of armaments, for which you extracted your pound of flesh.

--A tiny amount of 190 degree water is not a substitute for a large amount of 140 degree water. (Fahrenheit)
  Eh ?  Do try to catch up with the rest of the world.

--The motorcar has been around 100 years, do consider designing roads taking this fact into consideration.
  We do, our modern roads are much faster than your freeways, problem is the rest of it was planned, and I use the term loosely, well before 100 years ago.

--Schoolboy buggery isn't fun for 50% of the participants.
  Difficult for me to comment on because I never went to public school (what to you is private school).
  Look, to keep it short, the aristocracy are not like the rest of us, believe me, they are just different.

--Two adults of normal weight shouldn't have to slide sideways to pass when meeting on a stairwell.
  You are not supposed to pass on stairwells, it is bad luck !

--India isn't grateful for your 'help'.
  Oh dear, another American favourite. Some bits were very grateful and others were not.  How do you think a small country controls a large one ?
  Well you could use shock and awe, as the US does, but it has never been tried against a bigger country has it ?
  The Empire used divide and conquer, it got results without wholesale slaughter.  If the Empire killed in India at the rate US killed in Iraq there would not have many left to  celebrate independence.  

--While you think you are all 'British', the Scots, Welsh and others are fully aware there are the 'English' and 'others'.
  You really should not listen to Gordon Brown.  There are the English, the Scots, the Welsh, the Irish and the Cornish. The rest call themselves British and Gordon Brown calls all
  of us British, apart from the Scots, who retain their distinctive name, unless they are politicians in London, in which case they are at all times British. Got it? 

--After 18 months I could not understand the actual dialect of your country, 'yob'.
  There is no dialect, there are many.  No wonder you were confused.

--You treated Di like shit until she was dead, then had a nationwide attack of amnesia.
  Aristocracy again.  Di was an aristocrat, arguably better bred than Her Majesty herself.  Every now and again the people become infatuated by some aristocrat,
  Di was such an example.  The people didn't treat her like shit, it was other aristo's.

--For a people so concerned with 'good breeding', you pointedly ignore the several hundred years you've been exporting your best DNA.
  You really don't get aristocracy do you ?  It has nothing to do with ""quality"" of DNA or quality of anything else for that matter. 
  It has everything to do with how long your family have owned their stately pile and how long they have been at court, in this case the royal court.
  But you are quite correct about exporting the best DNA, much of it has gone to your own country.  Even so, even the best DNA can't perform miracles against the rise of
  Chinese DNA.  The US is fucked, just like the rest of the west.

--1066 was actually a defeat.
  Jesus Christ ! Aristocracy again, FFS stop passing comments on something you clearly have not got a clue about.
  1066 was regime change.  The Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was replaced by the Norman aristocracy.  Again, to keep it brief, William, Duke of Normandy got a lucky win
  against the Anglo-Saxon king Harold, who had just seen off the Norwegian King Harald, so was feeling a little tired and not at his best.
   
  William declared himself king and owner of everything by right on conquest. Now, to be fair to William, he didn't just think one day that ""me and my posse"" are going to have
  a piece of England, he thought he had a valid claim to the English throne, but he was not the only one, Harald of Norway thought the same.
  This came about because of the way these people were all interrelated through marriages.
  Once again, keeping if brief, if king A wanted to conclude a treaty with king B he would send a daughter to be married to one of king B's sons.
  So if a king died without any obvious heir (ie a son or brother) then the throne could be legitably be taken by anyone with a valid claim.
  Now the previous Anglo-Saxon king, Edward the confessor, had indeed died without an heir, leaving the throne available to anyone who could show they were related.

  That is why the aristocrats have such a thing about producing an heir, and incidentally what Di was all about.  


--The Romans left due to problems elsewhere, not due to one posed by the locals.
  Quite so, except for the Scots.  Any Scot will tell you the Romans never conquered Scotland (even if it was inhabited by Picts rather than Scots at the time).

--Top Gear misleadingly edited the Tesla episode.
  Bugger !

--The English drink a lot of Budweiser.
  Yes, but isn't that the real one rather than the pale US imitation ?

--BSE was your own fault (Cattle should not be forced to be cannibals)
  True, but don't get too smug about it. You have your own dirty little secrets like corn syrup

--your computer industry peaked around 1980 with Clive Sinclair.
  It is far worse than that, an opportunity squandered by a misguided Chuchill.

--HRH's main remaining purpose is to bring in tourist revenue.
  You are only jealous !

--Your GDP has slipped to #5 behind Spain.
  Nonsense !  Source ?

--The Sept 2008 financial crisis was started from London.
  Nonsense ! Source ?

--Walk 1 block the wrong direction from Victoria station and you are likely to be stabbed by a heroin addict for your poor judgment.
  Yes, London is shit, but then so are most of your cities too.

--The millenium wheel. A thousand years to plan, and that's what you came up with?
  Well, actually the dome was even worse.

--You collectively sold your nations' soul for a BP's partial concession of oil revenues in Iraq?
  Don’t blame us it was the cunt Blair.

--The sloppily botched faked suicide of a microbiologist that even the youngest child could tell was phony.
  As above

--4 hours to drive 20 blocks in London (ask me how I know)

--Every year Christmas and Boxing Day create some sort of unforsee-able panic that leads to the shelves of the local Tesco to be stripped bare...

t3_bm67j,Seattle,4,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9987634420394897,"I'm a huge fan of Capitol Hill, but of course it all depends on what you're looking for.

What attracts me to Capitol Hill rather than a place like Ravenna is the density: Here I can walk to most places I'd want to go, and I'm always discovering new events and stores and restaurants right under my nose. If closely located awesomeness is important to you, then definitely move here. Woostastik has the other side right, although ambulances and street rats depends entirely on your location. There are definitely some more quiet residential areas here, but they'll always be a little more expensive than Ravenna, and yard-less.

I live near the Olive/Denny intersection, and pay $1000 for a decently large two bedroom with my girlfriend and another roommate. I've just started looking for a new cheaper place here, and it looks like it'll be pretty easy, especially if I **walk down the street and phone places rather than just read craigslist**. If you really want a yard, while still being reasonably close to Capitol Hill, try the CD/Cap Hill divide: Olive and 22nd, Pike and 25th, the back side of Cherry Hill, etc. If you're just into it for the gardening/food, you may be able to sign up for an urban garden.

**Edit** Speaking as a mild mannered introvert who enjoys culture, I can't overstate how wonderful it is to live close to amazing things. Capitol Hill has the benefits of true urbanity: specialized commerce and information and culture within walking distance. It makes me happy knowing that a cheese shop is opening up down the street, near the Spine and Crown (one of the best small bookstores in Seattle—also Pilot Books is amazing, replacing Revolution Books which has moved to Pioneer Square—which incidentally gives the best deals for selected used books, along with Magus Books in the U district), or that if I want dessert I can walk to Molly Moons, Cupcake Royale, Top Pot Doughnuts, Old School Frozen Custard and a monthly ice cream tasting event run by some organization I can't remember are all here.

Munich you don't really need to use public transport much.

You definitely should budget some money for it, because sometimes you'll have to use public transportation, and sometimes it'll just be more convenient and you'll want to do it. Maybe 100 Euro or so.

2) I can understand hating buses, but trains go to specified, known places so they should be easy to manage in any case. I've used upwards of 50 different subway systems and never found one that even required a second thought to navigate (except making transfers at some Paris Metro stations; they can be labyrinthine - but on the other hand there are some jewels of buskers down in the larger stations that make the wandering worthwhile)."

You don't have to use the Metro. Paris has Velib', a shared bike system. As long as you have a European credit card (or an American Express card), you can get virtually unlimited use of bicycles for 1 euro per day or 5 euro per week.

There are tens of thousands of bikes located at over a thousand spots around the city. You can take a bike from any spot and drop it off at any other. The only restriction is that you can only use a single bike for 30 minutes at a time or else you have to pay a late fee.

I'm a frequent visitor to Paris for work and I've completely stopped using the Metro, it's all two wheels for me now. It's a truly wonderful way to see the city.

The Thailand/Lao/Cambodia/Vietnam area is *very* common, and once you arrive in bangkok you'll surely find people who are on the same route.

Anyway, here's my recommendation.  I've thrown in a bunch of sidetrips (marked with a star) which you may want to not do if you don't have the time.

Start in Bangkok

* Side trip to south Thailand, catch ferry to either Koh phan ngan or Koh Samui, back to Bangkok

* Side trip to Kanchanaburi.  The waterfalls at the arawan national park are beautiful.

Get your Vietnam visa now before leaving bangkok for the final time.

Bangkok to Chiang Mai, take overnight train and book in advance.  If trains are booked, the bus is about half the price and can be done in half the time, but it's a tad bit more uncomfortable and much less scenic.  CM is a very lovely city, see the tigers, elephants.  There's also cock fighting and lots of muay thai shows.  have a spicy papaya salad.

Bus to Nong Khai (~12 hours).  Optionally: stop in Sukhothai, splitting the bus ride into two 6 hour trips.  Nong Khai is a wonderful northern thai city settled on the mekong river with lots of bbq and clubs.  see the buddha garden/park.

Bus to Vientiane, you can pick up the visa at the border; bring 35-50USD to pay for it.  Vientiane has some pretty sweet temples and awesome massage shops. 
Bus to Vang Vieng.  Traditional backpacker trail.  If you want happy shakes and/or opium tea this is the place to get it.  BE CAREFUL OF PLAINCLOTHES COPS, I can't stress this enough.

* Side trip to Pohnsavanh.  See the famous plain of jars, one of the most bombed regions in the world.

* Side trip to Luang Prabang -- I never went here, but a ton of other backpackers did..dunno what all the hype is about.

Back to Vientiane (bah! sorry!), but all buses from north lao run through here as a hub.

Bus to Tha khaek.  See the buddha cave, and * if you're adventurous, check out the 1km long river-cave.. It's like 40km out of tha khaek so it's not particularly easy to get to.

Bus to Pakse, as a stopover.  See whatever you like...haven't been personally ;)

Bus to Si Pan Don (4000 islands).  Enjoy the awesome atmosphere.

Bus to Siam Reap, get visa on arriaval.  You know what to do here.

Bus to Phnom Penh.  

Path 1: To go Sihanoukville and check out [the happy hippi](http://www.happyhippicambodia.com/).  Then into Vietnam via Ha Tien.

Path 2: Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh.

I haven't been to vietnam yet, so I can't say much about it (I'll be there in about 1-1.5 months) but the basics would include nha trang, da nang, vinh, and ha noi.  

You could fly out of ha noi.  

I've been traveling a year and flown four times times (US-&gt;London, Turkey-&gt;Egypt, Egypt-&gt;India, India-&gt;Thailand) for a total of 1400$.  I don't know how that compares to RTW ticket prices.

My favorite cafe in Prague is called Dobra Trafika, it's in the Vinohrady neighborhood.

If you like partying, you may want to check out Ostrava.  It's a city in the Czech Republic's far east, nearly on the Slovak/Polish borders.  There's a street downtown there called Stodolni street, which has roughly 90 or so pubs/bars/discos/etc.  My favorite might be the Amsterdam Coffeeshop, Medvedev, or Barney's.

Other cities in Czech that are amazing: [Jindrichuv Hradec](http://www.zamky-hrady.cz/3/img/jin_hradec_centr_let.jpg)  Has the third largest castle in the country, behind Prague and Cesky Krumlov, respectively.

[Cesky Krumlov](http://leto.in-pocasi.eu/cesky-krumlov/cesky-krumlov2.jpg) is a gorgeous, quaint little medieval town which has been kept in good shape.  If it looks familiar, you've probably seen it in the film Hostel.  There's a gypsy bar here that is AWESOME.  

Beers to drink: obviously Pilsner Urquell.  Go to the bar and say jeden Plzen, prosim (yeden pullzen, proseem).

Staropramen.  Brewed in Prague.  Fucking delicious.

Radegast.  Harder to find around Prague, as it's brewed in Nosovice, which is closer to Ostrava.  This one is my favorite though.

Gambrinus.  Heaven, in liquid form.

Aside from serving as the communications arm of the totally research-oriented Media Research Center, the blog network Newsbusters also serves as a perfect example of why social conservatives will never abandon their preferred premise regarding the mainstream media’s fundamental bias against the right. I myself was targeted by MRC head honcho Tim Graham just last month for having made the case that the Catholic Church has a long and sordid history of criminal activity that makes the priesthood’s collection of suspiciously sticky Tiger Beat back issues look benign by comparison; as far as I can tell, his objection was that I had said a lot of really mean things about the Catholic Church, and that this was indicative of something. Presumably, it is not indicative of anything that my anti-religious screeds never manage to make it into any mainstream publications, whereas I’m usually more than welcome to attack various institutions and individuals who don’t have massive followings permeating throughout the most lucrative magazine-buyer demos. It’s almost as if individual editors and publishers are motivated by something other than hatred for all things good and true.

Today, Newsbusters contributor Jeff Poor busts that news by pointing out that media outlets are talking about RedState founder and recently-hired CNN contributor’s Erick Erickson’s spirited monologue to the effect that he doesn’t feel like filling out his census form (and neither do I), and in fact will pull a shotgun on whatever hypothetical federal government agents come and try to force him to do so. Although I agree that it would be awesome if Erickson were to point a shottie at a group of federal agents and thereby learn the difference between Republican fantasy and harsh reality, I nonetheless feel it necessary to point out a few things to Mr. Poor here before I go back to fantasizing about that myself.

1. The headline of Poor’s piece refers to some “witch-hunt” against Erickson. A witch-hunt involves a bunch of people looking for something that probably isn’t there, like a witch. In this case, a bunch of people are pointing to an incident that clearly occurred and making fun of the douchebag in question.

2. Witch-hunts, incidentally, are still engaged in – not by my crowd, but rather Poor’s fellow religious folk in certain parts of Africa, where suspected witches are still killed. Although polls indicate that about a fifth of Americans believe in witches, these Americans are apparently too lazy to hunt any witches down themselves. At any rate, it might be time to adapt some phrase that (a) applies and (b) doesn’t remind people about the sorts of things religious conservatives get down to when secularists aren’t around to hold their hand through reality.

3. Poor states that “Politico has joined the fray and is taking news tips from left-wing storefronts,” by which he means Media Matters. Quick thing to think about, Poor: if Keith Olbermann went on some talk radio show and started jabbering a bunch of wanna-be tough guy nonsense about how he was inclined to pull a gun on the feds if they try to make him fill out a form that’s used to figure out how many seats each particular state ought to be alloted in the House (the bastards!), and Red State reported on it, Politico would pick it up, just like they’ll pick up any potentially damaging Democratic PR move. It’s news. They report on news, particularly if it involves unusual or deranged behavior, like CNN’s decision to hire Erick Erickson over some better conservative commentator.

4. I’d like Mr. Poor to note that mainstream outlets not only pick up stories from conservative bloggers just as they do liberal bloggers, but also pick up actual conservative bloggers on occasion – despite all of the good reasons not to. For instance, Erick Erickson is the second blogger from Red State to be picked up by a major news outlet, and he’s already not sounding as tough and uncompromising as he does in text or on some Georgia radio station – his recent segment with Howard Kurtz should be particularly embarrassing to everyone who has a stake in seeing this fellow succeed. Now, a few years back, The Washington Post made the mistake of taking on yet another Red State blogger, Ben Domenech, as a columnist. A few days later, he was shown to have plagiarized a bunch of stuff that only a fool would have had to plagiarize. He responded with forced laughter and various half-assed excuses. Then, more plagiarism was revealed. He blamed his old college newspaper editor. Then, so much more plagiarism was found that even Michelle Malkin came out and said that the guy was guilty. Then Domenech, being a literalist Christian who got to his then-current station by way of family ties and who was such a mediocre writer that he’d had to lift someone else’s review of that Final Fantasy movie instead of just explaining why it sucked and had no relation to the games whatsoever, took one last swipe at all the nation’s non-conservatives, noting that at least they were spending their time attacking him and not America. Fellow really jumped on a grenade there.

5. In light of the above, I’d ask Mr. Poor how many more of these degenerate, no-talent Young Earthers the MSM needs to sully themselves with before Newsbusters is satisfied?

It’s also worth noting that CNN could have seen this sort of nonsense coming if they’d bothered to look; Red State has long laid claim to the title of Internet Tough Guy, USA, and rarely does a day pass on that misguided manifestation of Web 2.0 that an administrator does not force some mere user to apologize for having accidentally implied something or ban some wayward troll with a sprinkle of bad action movie dialog. The culture being as it is, Erickson is almost certainly unembarrassed by his goofy outburst, and one has to wonder at such a person, or rather not wonder at all. When I was quite a bit younger and in some emotional turmoil over the death of a female to whom I’d been close, I myself challenged someone on the other end of an internet debate to an actual fight when I stupidly considered the honor of some of my military veteran relatives to have been sullied through the proceedings, and though I soon apologized for having acted in such a ridiculous manner, I’m still occasionally shaken by embarrassment when the incident comes to mind. That there exists a class of people who take routine and flamboyant pains to illustrate their badassness to the world, offering fistfights to people half a continent away and conjuring up improbable scenarios whereby they would win the day through manliness and shotguns, is of course very amusing. When some of these people are given positions of extraordinary influence within the nation’s most prominent news outlets, it’s alarming, though still amusing. When it happens, though, it’s time for religious conservatives to calm down a bit and acknowledge that the deficits of the mainstream media are actually working in their favor.

For those people who do not suffer from the handicap of being Jeff Poor, I would once against propose that you spend a few minutes in considering my proposal by which we may perhaps have a wholesome effect on such things as CNN.

Update 10:40 PM EST

As True/Slant’s Charles Johnson notes, The Washington Post ombudsman Andrew Alexander acknowledges this weekend that many of their own commenters are in the habit of writing off-color nonsense under that publication’s various online articles. Johnson also reminds us that Post media critic Howard Kurtz has done quite a bit of what is known as “concern trolling” over the uncivil and bizarre comments that appear on various non-MSM blogs, including LGF itself back in the days before Johnson began to rid himself of the ridiculous folks who inevitably show up at any online forum. Incidentally, Johnson’s idiotic exiles have since found new homes within the Pajamas Media/Townhall/RedState coalition-in-spirit, where people of the sort are not only welcomed but often given their own blogs.)"

I'll answer the questions that I can:

**Rent** - I live in the central district in a large house with 6 other people. I pay $550 a month in rent and utilities, on average.

**Dog friendly** - Yes. Very. Coffee houses and businesses here often have cans of dog biscuits at the registers, and your dog can ride the bus if you pay for it.

**Economy** - I moved here with about 3 years of ad agency/studio experience and it took me about 2.5 months to find a minimum wage internship position at a local ad agency. Things have recently gotten better, but that was a dark and unpleasant 5 months. Minimum wage is hard to live on in this town.

Best and worst? Hrm...

**Good**:

* There are a ton of parks here. A ton! So many to explore that I haven't had the time to see them all. Also, everything is very close and there's not as much sprawl as you might find in Texas.

* I once had a tank of gas last me 3 months because I bike everywhere. There are many bike lanes and it's a good city for it.

* There's always something to do.

* Attitudes are generally very accepting and liberal.

* People here are very green, if you're into that kind of thing. For me this was kind of a neutral point but an interesting culture change.

**Bad**:

* Parking. One of the biggest shockers is how hard parking is to find here. If you want to go anywhere in your car, be prepared to pay for it.

* I hope you can live without the sun, because it goes away from late October to about mid April. Frankly, I'm having trouble dealing with it. There are occasional moments and days of sunshine, but not as many as the latitude that we're from.

* People here tend to be very cold. The phrase ""the Seattle Freeze"" gets thrown around a lot. [This article explains it pretty well.](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2005/0213/cover.html) Essentially, it will be hard to meet people when you move here. Well, you'll *meet* them, but it's hard to make friends with natives. I have lived in Seattle almost a year now, and out of the 30 or so people I consider my friends, only 2 grew up in the area. The rest moved in from somewhere else.

There's more to it than this I think. In other places I've been, random conversations *turn into* friendships. Here, that's where they begin, and end. This concept seems so utterly foreign to Seattleites that I'm pretty convinced few locals even see the point in such an activity.

The one thing I will say that may seem judgmental is this: Seattleites are *way* too reserved. On the street, in the malls, at the bus stop, everybody is in their own world - zero interaction with the world and people around them. This is annoying, since it creates an incredibly cold and ""dead"" city vibe. There are places in the world where chatting with someone on the bus won't creep people out, where the street is an actual hang-out, not just a conduit from indoor space A to indoor space B.

If we are to allow the official story to stand then we are complicit in allowing the military, of any country, to freely kill whoever they like and to lie to our faces about it.

You also mentioned level *design* being good somewhere, when in fact it sounded (to me) as if you just meant, well, level *decoration* (graphics). If the gameplay indeed consists of (literally, since it's in a metro?) *rails*, it's probably a very uninspired layout design. If you mention stupid AI that ""just runs towards you"", it might actually be another layout design flaw, not giving them any room for maneuvers (or even any motivation for programmers to write code for such scenarios). Half-Life, for example, sent you from one ""arena"" to the next, in a linear order, but each allowing a myriad of ways of fighting. Think the room where you first encounter the female assassins, the blind tentacles or most encounters with squads of human grunts. Metro 2033, in comparison, seems to mostly consist of corridors and placing all enemies straight in front of you, not even giving enemies a *chance* to use any advanced AI, so it might be a layout/level design flaw as well as an AI one. There are many layers between ""linear"" and ""rail shooter"" and Metro 2033 seems to lean towards the latter more than most other FPSs I ever encountered (even more than the new CoDs).

- no fear of lynching
- the winters suck, to be sure, but you buy some warm clothes and you deal with it.
- public transit is pretty decent. Not as good as, say, NYC, but you can get around. Depends what part of the city you live in, though.
- I've heard the TC is very similar to Seattle in terms of meeting people. A lot of people here seem to have grown up around here and hang out with the same people they've known for the past 10 years. But then again, I'm no good at meeting people so what do I know.
- I've never seen a tornado in the past 3.5 years. We get a lot of snow. There are tornado warning sirens but I only hear them when they get tested.
- plenty of tech people out here.

I actually really like the Twin Cities. It's a nice size -- not overwhelmingly big but still big enough that there are great restaurants and bars, a thriving local music scene, and typical 'culture' stuff like an excellent orchestra, great live theater, and art museums.

I went because other road users were being ignorant to cyclists (as well as pedestrians) and people were dying because of it. [Just recently, 2 cyclists were killed by HGV's in successive days](http://www.movingtargetzine.com/article/two-london-cyclists-killed-in-two-days-by-lorries) but thankfully, the incidents resulting in cyclists deaths has dropped a lot over the last few years.

The plan was to ride as a massive peloton and make ourselves visible to the point where we could not be ignored, re-enforcing the viewpoint that ""we are road users as well!"".

On the few rides I went on, the amount of hostility from drivers was incredible and it was easy to see why people in the mass ended up coming to blows with them. In one instance, I saw a bus drive at a cyclist and crush his bike, getting out of the way just in time all because the bus driver lost patience with the mass not moving fast enough. In my mind, that is attempted murder but absolutely nothing was done about it by the Police cyclists that accompanied us.

I will concede that CM is more than likely populated mostly by hipster wankers who are out to fuck people off because that's exactly what they do best (and there are plenty of those cunts in London nowadays) but you could make parallel comparisons to the Tea Party movement: they had some genuine concerns and felt angry enough to get mobilised by have now been swamped by racist, ignorant cunts with their own shitty crap agenda and a complete lack of philosophy behind it.

It's very close to Euston station and is walkable to the british museum. You'll probably end up on the sixth floor though. Don't know why, but I always seem to. There's a lift though.

Failing that, I also often try to save a few pounds staying at a hostel - the best site for that is http://www.hostelworld.com - in fact, if you want to stay in a 6 bed dormitory you will be able to find very very cheap deals (€13 per person per night for a 6 bed dorm) at hostelworld.com - I've used that site several times.

Science museum (Tube: South Kensington),

Bletchley Park, home of the national museum of computing, the enigma codebreakers, Alan Turing (Tube: Euston, then national rail to Bletchley, BP is right next to the station).

Other parts of london I really like are: Hyde park (just a big park), Cleopatra's needle (tube: embankment - just feels like you're right in the center of the city), the cafe at the top of the Tate Modern - great view across london (tube: southwark), river trips, covent garden market is fun.

&gt; Do I have to fear lynching because I am an outsider from California?

I'm a Californian and no one cares.  Be prepared to answer the question of why you moved here even though it's so cold.

&gt; How bad are the winters really? I've only been to Minnesota in the summer (I-90) and it wasn't bad, just a bit humid (I'm used to 120 degree weather here, although 20% humidity).

Depends on how you handle cold and how you handle snow.  I like the cold so that's not a big deal, however cold (except for the few extreme days a year) can easily be handled by bundling up more anyways.  The real deal is the snow, which makes transportation a huge problem.  I'm not just talking about snowing, but also the snow when it's left, it's not something most Californians are used to.

Summers are better in California.  It's hotter temperature-wise but the humidity here makes it feel worse.

&gt; How is public transit in the cities? I have an old car that gets terrible milage and would rather take transit than pay a fortune for gas (Please don't say sell it because that isn't going to happen, this car and I go way back).

Heavily depends on where you're going.  Transit can either be a dream or worthless.  For example, I can easily get downtown using the buses, which is great; but at my last job it would've been a three hour multi-transfer bus trip (one way), when it only took me 20 minutes to drive there.  Don't depend on giving up your car.

You could also be one of those guys who bikes everywhere.  It's possible in the cities.

&gt; Is it easy to meet people? I wouldn't know anyone there, and want to avoid a place that has a nickname for its anti-social population (The Seattle Freeze).

I wouldn't say this place is antisocial by any means, though I'm not really a ""go out and meet people"" sort of person anyways so it's hard to say.

&gt; Do you get insane weather often? (Tornados and stuff like that)

Not really.  A tornado fucked up a store a year ago, but that was the only extreme weather I've heard of since coming to Minneapolis three years ago.

t3_bmxas,economy,2,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9472929835319519,"&gt;To go off topic from the premise of the article, this site has a bunch of maps from the 2004 election that are pretty interesting. Considering this  is probably what most people think of America, it shows how heavily distorted it can be. When you look at it as a scale instead of polar and include per capita statistics, you get this  and this  which paints a better picture (the type you allude to). I also found this  quite interesting.

Exactly (and those are the maps I had in mind, and even they are somewhat of a distortion -- especially [this one - county level winning party](http://makethemaccountable.com/misc/images/Election2004-3D.jpg) which merely repeats the mistake of [this one - state level winning party](http://makethemaccountable.com/misc/images/Election2004ByState.jpg) on a more detail basis -- they are distortions since ALL urban residents do NOT vote Democratic and ALL rural people do NOT vote Republican, the districts are ALL intermixed with some the percentages voting simply ""leaning"" to one party or another). 

The ""Blue"" states are actually ""purple"" -- with the prevalent cities and urban areas tending to lean more heavily toward Democrats; and the likewise the ""Red"" states are also ""purple"" with the rural areas tending to lean a bit more Republican -- yes there are some (rare) exception districts where the ""leaning"" is more pronounced (an 80/20 or 90/10 mix) but a lot of THAT has to do with the artificial ""gerrymandering"" of the political parties colluding in a tit-for-tat manner to CREATE such aberrations in order to secure various ""seats"" for their respective parties -- with the secondary goal of making certain that 3rd parties have nowhere to gain a foothold.)

To bring it back to the article's premise -- the thing is that if there is any ""civil unrest"" in the future it will almost certainly be of the Detroit/LA/New Orleans ""riot/looting"" nature than of anything like a ""civil war"". 

So, yes there is substantial political (and resource) difference between the rural areas and the city areas -- but an all-out ""war""?  Unlikely that the urban hordes would venture into the rural areas in order to ""seize"" the farms (what would clueless urban-ites do with a farm? besides, most of the big ""inventories"" of food and other resources are in the cities) -- and it's just as inconceivable that the rural people would en-mass rush into the distant cities (why would they want to?)

Much more likely (if resources become REALLY scarce and worst would come to worst and we ended up in some *dystopia-like* future) would be that the urban dwellers would first turn and attempt to riot and eventually prey and loot each other (shades of Detroit, LA, Paris, Greece, or even ancient Rome, etc.) -- and the rural types will ""guard and protect"" themselves from whatever small groups of urban-ites even attempt to relocate to the countryside, etc.  I guess you could call that ""civil war"" but I doubt it would last for long."
t3_bmeoo,ILiveIn,3,0,4,POSITIVE,0.9986022114753723,"Here's my list of best London places:

- All the Museums, especially the Imperial War Museum (that usually has some cool summer exhibitions), V&amp;A, Natural History Museum, the Tate Modern, and definitely some of the smaller ones I mentioned to Quellman below if any of them catch your interest.
- Definitely a walk, as I mentioned to Quellman in the reply below, it's most fun to get a book (search 'London walks' on Amazon or go to the Waterstone's I mentioned to Quellman once you're here) and do your own, but you can also join one of these: http://www.walks.com/ Plus, if you go on your own walk, you can take your time, stop at pubs and places to eat along the way, etc.
- The Tower of London is a big tourist attraction but is definitely worth it (take a guided tour), the British Library and the British Museum are good too. Some of the overpriced, overhyped, tourist trap attractions are Madame Tussauds and the London Dungeon, but maybe you'll want to see them anyway.
- Go to Borough Market for breakfast one morning (you walk around and eat delicious bits from various stalls), preferably on a weekday. In terms of other markets, a lot of tourists will go to Portobello Road Market on a Saturday, but more Londoners go to Broadway market: http://www.broadwaymarket.co.uk/
- See a play at Shakespeare's Globe.
- Seeing a film at the BFI or a play at the National Theatre is cool, but you can use the BFI Mediatheque for free and it's got loads of stuff. 
- A tour of Middle and Inner Temple and the Temple Church (http://www.visitthecity.co.uk/index.php/attractions/view/272/)
- Highgate Cemetery 
- The Enchanted Palace exhibition at Kensington Place will be on while you're here and looks pretty interesting: http://www.hrp.org.uk/KensingtonPalace/stories/palacehighlights/EnchantedPalace.aspx
- It will be summer, so try to be outdoors as much as you can be. Go and have a picnic on Hampstead Heath or, more centrally, around the Serpentine in Hyde Park, where you can go boating. This is what many Londoners do in summer. There is also opera in Holland Park (a smaller park, complete with bunny rabbits and peacocks and rose gardens) in June in the evenings. Visiting the Chelsea Physic Garden in summer is also really nice: http://www.chelseaphysicgarden.co.uk/
- Have a drink in one of the oldest pub in London, the Lamb, on Lambs Conduit Street in Bloomsbury.
- Walk around Brick Lane 
- Visit Postman's Park http://www.thejoyofshards.co.uk/london/tiles/ppark/index.shtml
- Taste of London - a big festival where lots of famous London restaurants have a food festival will be on in June: http://www.tastefestivals.com/london/
- Go on a behind the scenes tour at the BBC: http://www.bbc.co.uk/tours/

Finally, do not go to Aberdeen Angus Steakhouse or Garfunkel's restaurants. They are horrible places with terrible food, overpriced and tourist traps. 

The best advice generally is when you get here, buy the latest edition of 'Time Out', go through it, and pick out all the things you want to go to - there are always exhibitions, events, parties, etc happening in London and it changes every week. You'll find probably more things you want to do than you have time to do them in. A lot of Londoners depend on Time Out to know what is happening, so this your best bet. I hope you have a great time :)

Oh, and 1 more tip, if you're here for more than a week, buy an Oyster card from the tube station to get around, you can use it on any public transport and you just top it up with money at tube stations. It makes everything significantly cheaper - e.g. a bus trip is £2 for a normal ticket, but 80p with an Oyster card, and they cap it at a daily travelcard rate. You can even get a special visitor one: http://visitorshop.tfl.gov.uk/

It depends on where you are planing on living.  In general, you should have your first months rent, and another months rent for a deposit.  If you are going to find a place through a broker (which I recommend) Add an additional months rent.  I'd recommend a broker because there are so many place in NYC that are only on the market for literally a day, and on top of that I can't tell you how many people I meet that have sent a check for their deposit, only to have the prospective landlord disappear with their money.  Most of these places are on craigslist, so find a place on a reputable real-estate agency like [Corcoran](http://www.corcoran.com/).  Ask for Lisa Teahan.  She was our broker and was honest, quick and fair.

&gt; How long did it take you to find a job? Do you know if the market for web designers is growing there? I know a lot of designers are in NYC, but I'm worried the market might be over saturated.

There are a lot of designers in NYC, more here than I've met before, most of which I have met through jobs that they have acquired on Craigslist.  I'd talk to your friends about what they think is the best solution to find work in your field.  I personally work in the TV/Live event industry, and started slowly through word of mouth through unions.  I transferred through my job out here, but it took months for me to find the job before I left. I don't know if this helped, but I'd definitely talk to your friends about what they think would be the best route to go.

&gt; I'm thinking of moving to either Williamsburg or Astoria, but I'm worried the rent might be a little steep. Are there any areas I should consider that aren't as pricey

Both places are a bit overpriced, Williamsburg more than Astoria.  For 650 sq ft in Astoria expect to pay around 1250 - 1400 a month, and maybe 1,500 - 1,700 in Williamsburg.  Keep in mind that what the landlords call ""East Williamsburg"" is not Williamsburg at all.  It's actually Bedford/Stuivesant (locally known as ""Bedsti"" -a VERY bad part of brooklyn.  Usually you hear about kids killed at birthday parties on the news, or gang fights, or murders there. Do NOT get a place there.  Astoria is pretty nice, but the closer you get to the East river, the closer you get to the projects, so if you are trying to get a place around there, try to get something that a 15 - 20 min walk to the ""N or W"" train.  The farther you are from the train, the safer and nicer the area gets (in general) and the prices are cheaper if you are looking for a good deal.

Believe it or not, the first stop in Jersey on the Jersey transit (Newport, NJ) is actually pretty awesome.  It's not too expensive and is quite safe and right along the hudson.  Any Any farther into Jersey, the areas become not too safe.  There is also Statin Island, along the northern end of the island.  There is a free fairy that will take you too and from the southernmost point in Manhattan.  Both of these places are 15 min to manhattan and have awesome views.  In addition to this, basically the farther you get away form manhattan, the cheaper the places will be.  I'd just avoid East Williamsburg, Bed-sti (Bedford / Stuivesant town), South Bronx, Harlem and Washington Heights.  Most other places are okay."

Did you get my point about including getting to and from the airport and getting on and off the plane? It adds time and money that isn't usually considered when making these comparisons. On a train, you generally travel from the centre of a city to the centre of a city, with budget air travel you have to add an hour either side of the flight to check in and out, and it can take up to an hour to travel between the centre of a city and the airport.

You can just keep going from Amsterdam to the Hague to Rotterdam to Antwerp to Brussels to Paris, one after the other.

I haven't taken the local train in many years - these days I always take the express (Thalys). If you want to get a cheap ride on the Thalys, you need to book weeks or even months advance. €25's about the cheapest I've seen it. The day before it goes as high as €125 in second class. The trip is theoretically about 3 hours (Paris-Amsterdam).

First class gets you a meal on board,  free wifi, and some more legroom. Sometimes there are specials where first class doesn't cost much more.

That's for the trip when you're doing it all in one go. For the other direction, you'll probably be taking the local trains, since it's a lot cheaper (domestic tickets are generally not valid on the Thalys)... except Brussels-Paris which is a long stretch.

For the domestic trains you can just rock up a few minutes before the trip if your credit card works in the machines. Mostly they're so frequent that you don't have to worry about schedules (except missing the last train of the evening). For example, trains from Amsterdam to the Hague leave around every 15 minutes."
t3_bnb3j,travel,1,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9819170832633972,"In the Netherlands you can rent bikes at almost every train station. It's usually about €8 per day. You cannot visit the Netherlands without riding around town (and preferably the countryside as well) on a bike; it's an essential part of the experience. There are bike paths everywhere and it's very flat so distances are easy.

In Paris I also recommend using the bike share system (Velib), it's a great way to really see the city rather than zipping underneath it on the Metro. You need an American Express card to pay; it's €1 per day or €5 for a week. Make sure you return the bike within half an hour each time you use it or you get dinged."

Transit is the lifeblood of a city, and we've desperately needed this.

Light rail on the 520 bridge would realistically create entire corridors of transit-covered neighborhoods, which will do untold wonders to our local economy, as well as help more people get rid of at least one car - a huge financial boon particularly to the poor."

It would take less time to get from end to end than it currently does to get from Ballard to the 520 onramps.

Then we might not need to worry about rail over the 520 bridge at all. When we're ready for a second rail crossing over Lake Washington, we could contemplate a separate crossing. I recall Sound Transit complaining that there would be no way for a line coming off the 520 bridge to join University Link anyway; rather than force a mode transfer at Montlake or a line transfer at UW, we could instead use McGinn's intra-city transit initiative for immediate benefit."

t3_bnccx,Seattle,1,0,4,NEGATIVE,0.949207603931427,"&gt; However, Ballard to Bellevue/Redmond via downtown Seattle is a terribly indirect route.

But it's entirely grade-separated, so it's a hell of a lot faster than the equivalent bus or car route, especially during rush hour when it matters most. Even going through the DSTT and across I-90 is better than sitting on the 520 bridge for over an hour. Grade separation is the key element--and it's important that if the Mayor puts a Ballard light rail line on the 2011 ballot, that it be entirely grade separated.

&gt; And that's the issue at stake here - the capability for LR to be augmented onto 520 in 10, 15, or 20 years, not immediately.

The issue *should be* Eastside access from north of the ship canal. We can have that in 10 years if we build a Ballard-UW line. Then we can worry about a second Lake Washington crossing. 520 is one alternative, but I believe [Seattle Transit Blog's discussion of the analysis](http://seattletransitblog.com/2010/04/06/mcginn-study-details-issues-with-520-light-rail/) is very fair in concluding that we should forget about rail over 520."

###Alison Des Forges


##Alison Des Forges, a witness to genocide, died on February 12th, aged 66

TWO plane crashes bookmarked Alison Des Forges’s life. The first was nearly 15 years ago, when a luxury jet carrying two African presidents was shot down by missiles over Rwanda. The second was last week, when a cramped commuter plane crashed in icy weather near Buffalo, New York, killing 50 people. The first crash served as the pretext for the swiftest genocide in history. The second silenced its most dogged witness, a tiny American lady with silver hair.

On April 6th 1994, Mrs Des Forges was at home in Buffalo. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were assassinated at 8.20pm that day, which was lunchtime in Buffalo. Twenty minutes later, a friend telephoned Mrs Des Forges from Kigali, the Rwandan capital. “This is it. We’re finished,” said Monique Mujawamariya, a fellow human-rights monitor.

Mrs Des Forges called her every half-hour, late into the night. She heard her describe steadily more alarming scenes—militiamen going from house to house, pulling people out and killing them. Eventually, they came to Ms Mujawamariya’s door. Mrs Des Forges told her to pass the telephone to the killers. She would pretend to be from the White House, she said, and warn them off. “No, that won’t work,” said Ms Mujawamariya. Then she added: “Please take care of my children. I don’t want you to hear this.” And she hung up.

From that moment on, Mrs Des Forges made a lot of noise. She was steeped in Rwanda’s turbulent history, having written her doctoral thesis about it in 1972. And she had a better sense than most of the evil that was brewing two decades later. She had spent years in Rwanda, investigating political violence for Human Rights Watch. She knew that a 1993 peace accord between the Hutu-dominated government and a Tutsi-led rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), was written in water, and that Hutu military leaders were mulling mass killings to avoid sharing power. She knew something terrible was afoot.

Shouting at the deaf
She made calls, sent faxes and frantically gathered information. By April 17th she was convinced that a full-blown genocide was under way. She was one of the first outsiders to say so. But everyone who mattered ignored her. Africa specialists at the State Department wept with her when she described what was going on, but who listens to Africa specialists? The top bureaucrats at the UN were concerned mostly with evacuating foreigners. President Bill Clinton was anxious to avoid another Somalia (where, the previous year, 18 American soldiers had been killed during a humanitarian mission). Mrs Des Forges could not even persuade the Pentagon to jam the radio broadcasts that co-ordinated the slaughter. It would have cost too much.

The genocide ended when the RPF rebels overthrew the Hutu government and seized power. For the next four years Mrs Des Forges led a team of researchers to dig up the facts. She then wrote the definitive account: nearly 800 pages of scrupulously footnoted horror. Future historians will depend on it. Her testimony helped put several of the perpetrators behind bars. And she made it impossible to argue, as many did at the time, that the genocide was a spontaneous explosion of ancient tribal hatred. She read the plans. She saw the receipts for half a million machetes.

In some ways, she was old-fashioned. Whereas other human-rights activists fuss about an ever-lengthening list of socio-economic “rights” (subsidised housing, fair trade, and so forth), Mrs Des Forges stuck to the basics, such as the right not to be murdered. She took extraordinary risks, rushing to the scenes of massacres and questioning killers when their blades were barely dry. She left out none of the ghastly details: the wives forced to bury their husbands before being raped; the baby thrown alive into a latrine.

She never went further than the facts allowed. Others might speculate that the genocide claimed 800,000 victims, or a million. She stuck with half a million, because she could substantiate it. Others assumed that if the genocidal Hutu regime were the bad guys, then the Tutsi rebels who overthrew them must be the good guys. Not so fast, said Mrs Des Forges: only one side was guilty of genocide, but both committed war crimes. The RPF killed perhaps 25,000 people in 1994, she reckoned.

Mrs Des Forges’s integrity made her unpopular with the RPF regime that still rules Rwanda. Last year, after she wrote a balanced but critical report about the Rwandan justice system, she was barred from the country. Shortly before she died, she spoke up for an exiled academic she thought was unjustly accused of taking part in the genocide. She never seemed to rest. A report she edited about violence in Congo was published posthumously.

What drove her? One story is revealing. In Burundi, Rwanda’s neighbour, tens of thousands of civilians were slaughtered in 1993. The Western media barely noticed. Hutu officers in Rwanda concluded that they could do the same thing, and no one would give a damn. Mrs Des Forges wanted to document such atrocities so meticulously, and publicise them so persistently, that people would have to give a damn. Her book was called, after a killer’s cry, “Leave None to Tell the Story”. She knew that story-telling matters.

Where? 

Off the top of my head:

  * New Delhi - under $1/standard ride
  * Seoul - under $1/standard ride
  * Tokyo - under $2/standard ride
  * Beijing - under $1/standard ride
  * Shanghai - under $1/standard ride
  * Hong Kong - under $2/standard ride
 
etc.  New York isn't the cheapest.  It's more middle of the pack, I think.  I have to say 'standard ride', as New York is quite unique in having a  single ticket price.  Usually the there's a base fair, which increases depending on distance traveled.  

EDIT:  OK here's a list with this plus some more expensive European subways:  http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/07/subway-fares-around-the-world.php  I think that lends itself to New York being neither high nor low cost.

The white dots are where the express trains stop, the black where the local trains stop.  On the express trains you'll be in the city in 30 minutes and will still be far enough away to enjoy some freedom.  If you want to stay in the city by your school, find a place with a roommate if you can't afford your own place.  Prices can be quite steep in Manhattan and Craigslist is a good place to find people who need a roommate.  If you are going to do this, I'd recommend looking at the place before you agree to stay there.  Some landlords can be quite schisty.

It is sad that due to a lack of time for a social life, as the Japanese work ethic is the highest in the world, that there are very few couples forming and therefore very few babies being born. But Japan has a very dense population as the country is roughly the size of California and has nearly half as many people as the entire US. So they will not be going extinct anytime soon.


Also, anyone familiar with Tokyo will know that there are thousands upon thousands of restaurants (aka places that serve food) which has nothing to do with obesity. The fact of the matter is that very few people drive to work and rely mostly on walking to and from train stations and bicycling. Additionally, there is not a lot of red meat consumption, which also helps a lot.

I've never been to Chicago (although it is high on my list) but I hear that the slums are REALLY bad and I'd stay away from them altogether.  Financially, I'd save up at least three months of rent for rent alone, and then maybe another 3-4k to hold you over for a bit while you are getting adjusted and finding work if you don't have a job already.  In NYC, as far as rent goes, you have your first months, your deposit (which is typically one months rent), and a broker fee if you use one (which is also one months rent).

The overwhelming majority of properties in all of those places are single-family houses, which you basically just don't find in an actual city. The US only really has a couple of proper cities: NYC, Chicago, and perhaps Boston. Arguments could probably be made for places like San Francisco, Seattle, and Philly, as well. Basically, and this is really only a proxy, if most people need a car to have a reasonable quality of life, it's not a city; if 90% of the people around you don't have a car, and you're not living in a ghetto or student district, it's probably a city.

t3_bngnn,RPI,1,0,3,NEGATIVE,0.9943990111351013,"Well, I didn't really apply to too many schools to begin with. My first choice was Carnegie Mellon's School of Design, but I didn't get in. I only had a very limited portfolio to show them, and I kinda figured it would be something I would have to transfer into or consider for graduate school anyway. I probably should have taken advantage of the fact that they let you apply to multiple schools and programs...

I was looking for a specific kind of school: a non-art school with a good design program, but also good science and technology programs as well (I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction and UI Design). Oh... and maybe some Social Studies and Humanities thrown in there as well. There aren't many schools that can offer that. Did I mention that I also wanted to live in a city?

So, other than RPI, I was accepted to Syracuse, but I have no real interest in it, also they didn't accepted me undecided, so I'd have to be a CS major. 

Also, University of Cincinnati's College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning for Industrial Design. This is the only reason I haven't accepted RPI's admission offer yet. It's one of the World's best Design schools, that happens to be connected to a mediocre public university.

Northeastern and UMass Amherst, but I applied to those just because I'm from Boston and wanted some secure options that are close to home. Not very interested in either of them.

The couple of schools I didn't get into besides CMU are great and competitive schools, but ultimately they didn't really have had anything I was seriously interested in. I might have gone to one of them, but probably only to wait out a year while I looked into transferring.

The funny thing is, I sort of applied to RPI as a joke. I applied the day after my friend was accepted Early Decision. I say ""sort of"" because I did visit it over summer vacation (it was on the way to another school and my Dad was more interested than I was.) and was impressed by the campus, but didn't really like the idea of living in Upstate New York. I wasn't sure I wanted to apply until my friend got in, then I did some research and found some things I liked. 

I mostly forgot about it until I was accepted and then I decided to look into it again. I had greatly underestimated the school and I was actually shocked that I had been accepted. Now that I've found out about things like EMPAC and Inventor's Studio, and the close proximity to a train station and airport... I'm actually pretty excited about the school.

I talked about this before...but I'll summarize.  The amount of people living in the city in CA is huge, which tends to lean the state towards what they want.  The politics in CA are going to be dominated by the people in the city, which kind of screws the rural areas.  The same thing happens in NY.  A lot of people in northern NY hate people from NYC because the same politics do not help the smaller cities and areas in the north.  Another example on why different areas should be allowed to have different rules.  If the city people in CA want strict gun laws in the cities, then go for it, but the people in the burbs and rural areas that are isolated and probably worried about cartels sweeping in should be able to keep different rules for their areas.

Same thing with my previous long-term relationship.  It's all about what excites you I guess and handjobs just don't excite me as much as they did when I was a horny high school virgin.

Er? So we hand out $50 fines that people can't afford to pay - what's the end result? We drag 'em off and lock 'em up for a little while... I fail to see how this will reduce incarceration, since it is the only teeth the city has to collect said fines.

&gt; Unfortunately even Jackson failed to grasp the entire picture and true cause.
Although Jackson had killed the central bank, the most insidious weapon of The Money Changers, fractional reserve banking, remained in use by the numerous state charted bank. This fuelled economic instability in the years before the civil war. Still the central bankers were out and as a result America thrived as an expanded west worth. During this time, the principal Money Changers struggled to regain their lost centralized power but to no avail.Then finally they referred to the old central bankers formula: war to create debt and dependency.
If they couldn't get their central bank any other way, America could be brought to its knees by plunging it into a civil war just as if they had done in 1812 after The First Bank of The United States was not recharted.

&gt; One month after the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, the first shots of the American Civil War were fired here at Fort Sumter South Carolina on April 12 1861. Certainly slavery was ""a"" cause for the civil war but not the primary cause.Lincoln knew that the economy of the south depended upon slavery and so before the civil war he had no intention of eliminating it. Lincoln had put it this way in his inaugural address only one month earlier:
&gt;* ""I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it now exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.""*

&gt;Even after the first shots were fired here at fort Sumter, Lincoln insists that the civil war was not about the slavery:
&gt;*""My paramount objective is to save the Union, and it is 'not' either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it.""*

&gt; So what was the civil war all about?
There were many factors at play. Northern industrialist had used protective tariffs to prevent the southern states from buying cheaper European goods. Europe retaliated by stopping cotton imports from the south.
The southern states were in a double financial bind. They were forced to pay more for most of the necessities of life while their income from cotton export plummeted. The south was angry.

&gt; But there were other factors at work. The Money Changers were still stunned, by Americans withdrawal from their control, 25 years earlier. Since then America's wildcat economy had made the nation rich, a bad example for the rest of the world. The central bankers now saw an opportunity to split the rich new nation, to divide and conquer by war. Was this just some sort of wild conspiracy theory at the time?

&gt; Well, let's take a look at what a well places observer of the scene had to say at the time.
His name was Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Germany, the man who united the German states a few years later. 

&gt;*""The division of the United States into federations of equal force was decided long before the Civil War by the high financial powers of Europe. These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they remained as one block, and as one nation, would attain economic and financial independence, which would upset their financial domination over the world.""* - Otto von Bismarck

&gt; Within months after the first shots here at Fort Sumter, the central bankers loaned Napoleon III of France, the nephew of the Waterloo Napoleon, 210 million francs to seize Mexico and station troops along the southern border of the U.S., taking advantage of their war, to violate the Monroe doctrine and return Mexico to colonial rule. No matter what the outcome of the civil war, a weakened America, heavily indebted to The Money Changers would open up central and south America again to European colonisation and domination.
The very thing, America's Monroe doctrine had forbade in 1823.

&gt; At the same time, Great Britain moved 11.000 troops into Canada and positioned them menacingly along America's northern border. The British fleet went to war alert, should a quick intervention be called for.
Lincoln knew he was in a double bind. That's why he agonised over the faith of the Union. There was a lot more to it than just differences between the north and the south. That's why his emphasis was always on 'union', and not merely the defeat of the south.

&gt; But Lincoln needed money to win. In 1961, Lincoln and his secretary of the treasury, Salmon T. Chase, went to New York to apply for the necessary loans. The Money Changers anxious to see the Union fail, **offered loans at 24 to 36% interest.** Lincoln said, thanks, but no thanks and returned to Washington. Lincoln sent for an old friend colonel Dick Tailor of Chicago, and put him on the problem of financing the war. During one meeting Lincoln asked Tailor, what discovered.

&gt; Tailor put it this way:
*""Why, Lincoln, that is easy: just get Congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes ... and pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them also.""*

&gt; When Lincoln asked if the people of United States would accept the notes Tailor said:
*""The people or anyone else will not have any choice in the matter, if you make them full legal tender. They will have the full sanction of the government and be just as good as any money; as Congress is given that express right by the Constitution.""*

&gt; So that's exactly what Lincoln did. In 1862-63 he printed up $450 million worth of the new bills.

The differences are generally small enough that given one person from, say, Canada and one from Angola, betting that the former has a higher IQ wouldn't be a *safe* bet -- just a marginally better one than going the other way.

In the context of the roles of heredity and upbringing, then, here's a question...  My understanding is that people can be trained to higher IQ scores -- dual n-back managed this or something like it, as I recall -- though that's obviously avoided in the context of group comparisons.  I liken this to training to increase my VO2max for running.  Train as I might in the latter case, though, I'll never have the VO2max of Lance Armstrong, and that's where heredity plays an important role in sport.

t3_bo3x2,politics,2,0,2,NEGATIVE,0.972981333732605,"&gt;Do you really think the quality of the houses in the US or building standards are that much lower to be non-comparable? Sorry, but I disagree with you. I used to be involved in the industry. Same products, same sourcing, many of the same building techniques.

No, I didn't say that they are non-comparable but if you only think of size of houses you are clearly twisting a comparison. And there is a difference in how you built houses in Europe and the US [e.g. insulation (because energy costs are kept high in Europe for environmental reasons), foundation works (you won't find a lot houses in Europe without a proper cellar) etc etc]. Also a huge part of the size of the houses isn't caused by the 'system' but just by the density of population - land is just cheaper in the US.

&gt;Access to public transit is a necessity in the more densly clusters of the EU.

It's not as much a 'necessity' but a choice / different political strategy. The US automobile lobby successfully worked for reduced spendings on a public transportation system. You can therefore equally argue that many people in Europe just don't need a car because the public transportation system is just so good. Also: fuel prices are obviously also kept high for environmental reasons.

Also materially only a certain percentage of the US is really blessed. For the average person, the small advantage of maybe having e.g. an extra TV faints in the disadvantages of having much less spare-time, having to worry about unemployment, health-care and just in general being less likely to be able to change their social class[1].

([1] I'm talking about the influence on how rich you are born. A person born to parents of a specific income group are more likely to stay in this income group in the US than almost every other western country (only Italy and the UK are as bad in this aspect) - due to access to education etc).


EDIT: If you look at the list you posted - you can quickly see that this isn't that representative of 'standard of living' - Puerto Rico is at #5 while the two (arguably) 'richest' countries (Norway and Switzerland) are at #15 and 16."

t3_bo90z,japan,9,0,2,POSITIVE,0.8420906662940979,"Being a JET, as mentioned by s0m3, is a great way to become an english teacher in Japan. You are an assistant to the teacher (who knows less english than you), to help the kids with english &amp; slang english at the request of the federal government of Japan. You are actually paid by the local district you are placed in. 

Pluses:  They get you a visa, fly you over, they do all the paperwork, get you a bank account, help get you to your home town (don't expect to be placed in a big town), and the local district sets you up with housing. The housing and bank account especially are pain in the ass to get - so having all this handed to you on a silver platter is AWESOME. 

You then get your hand held for an introduction to the Japanese school system with all it's pluses and minuses (8AM to 6PM days), along with simple Japanese, learning the way of life of most people and students - and methods (good and bad) of how they teach english to the kids. The head JET in the area is also a ombudsman of sorts for helping you with issues, though they don't have a lot of power. 

You sign up for 1 year, and renew your contract every year up to 3-5 years. at 5 years of being in Japan you can apply for residency, so you don't need a visa to stay.

The negatives: You are in the middle of nowhere (relatively speaking) in a small apartment on a smaller fixed income than you expected. Food costs more, transportation is primarily by walking or bike, with some train use, and rare car use (good luck with the license!). You are stranded from almost every comfort food, every known retail establishment, and if you are a big person - you can only buy clothes from big cities or shipped over from home.  You might live on campus, you might live nearby a cool city, or you might be in a small apartment next to a farm, and you won't really know what you are getting into until you have been there a couple months. 

To me though, the good outweighs the bad, and getting all your ducks in a row easily with the JET program lets you easily move on to another teaching position because all the visa paperwork done, a bank account already made, existing familiarity with Japan's culture and students, and a resume item that shows you have done english teaching assistance in Japan already. Having the chance to end up in the middle of nowhere to is a plus for me - I like the ""rural"" areas better than the big cities anyhow. Tokyo is too damn big for me. I'll stick with Kiryu.

Forget completely about the god concept for this question and focus strictly on organized religion. Religions are businesses, they drive massive amounts of money from parishioners to church coffers.

The vatican, for example, is a financial super power.  How can you justify helping drive this money train which takes from the poor and gives to the rich? 

Part 2:
Why don't you demand an accounting of donations and demand a say in the distribution of this money? Are you too cowardly to do so? Do you naively just ""trust"" it goes to noble purposes? Are you intimidated by the structure and just accept your lowly role and stay obedient and silent?  Or are you biding your time and waiting for your turn to cash in on the money train?

1.)ignore warnings from 'bad guys'
1b.)reports from BIG MONEY 3 letter agencies U.S. Government appear 'fuzzy'
2.)refuse to learn from Israelis, who armor the cockpit door and install
a good DOOR LOCK.
3.)throw money at the problem using the HIGHLY EFFECTIVE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
4.)same gov't working on 'health care'
5.)do not publish any REAL METRICS or reality numbers
Actually, there have been many more arrests of Federal air marshals than that story reported, quite a few for felony offenses. In fact, more air marshals have been arrested than the number of people arrested by air marshals. 
6.)rush to hire and 'fill spots with bodies' -  air marshalls are not thoroughly screened?
7.)refuse to give the pilots guns - cannot TRUST THE PILOT
8.)
	1, They break the chain of command of the pilot to cabin crew and passengers.
	2, They have access to weapons, which they can use as they see fit.
	Even maximum security prison GUARDS do not have guns, since it is
easy to 'lose a gun' while 'snoozing'
	3.)may be better to have a Taser to avoid catastrophic plane problem
from badly aimed bullets.  bullet hits fuel tank?
	4.)Bystanders can easily be shot
9.)No reports on training
10.)no emphasis on passenger screening rather than REACT AND SHOOT.
11.)Are they actually trustworthy?
	Who knows what documents they carry.  Obviously, should a 'bad guy'
get a fake or realistic looking gun on board of an aircraft, he might claim to be a 'AIR MARSHALL'
12.)It appears obvious as to who the MARSHALL might be
	Look for ball caps and military foot gear. They'll board first with the old people and kiddies though they are young and strapping fit. They'll usually sit in first class where they can keep an eye on the cockpit door.
	""stick out like a sore thumb""?
13.)lack of proper seating:
	why not have a seat that FACES BACKWARD looking at the rest of the
passengers?  It is easier to sneak up on someone from the back, isn't it?

14.)of course, policy has changed.  previously, passengers are told to
cooperate with 'bad guys' and let them fly the plane.

17.)go with smaller planes, smaller airports - rearchitect the infrastructure

	that would be billions and trillions of dollars of infrastructure
costs.


18.)go with HIGH SPEED RAIL - China - 226 mph bullet train.
	U.S. is one of the lowest ranked

19.)allow other police officer and other trusted personnel to carry
weapons.  There may be more than two or FIVE 'bad guys' who will overwhelm
just one marshall.

20.)maybe the real threat is 'baggage handlers'?

Recently, rent has been going down and you can probably get a one bedroom in Manhattan for under $2000.

At your salary, however, you may want to look into living off Manhattan and maybe even New Jersey. The commute is pretty easy and you get more for your money in places like Jersey City and Hoboken. But I 'll give you some recommendations I haven't seen yet:

* Astoria - You can find a wonderful mix of great restaurants and the rent is cheap. If you're close to one of the subway lines, it's like 15 minutes from Midtown. It's close to the 59th street bridge, so taking a taxi home is relatively easy/cheep. You won't have to deal with so many hipsters as you would in Brooklyn.
* Long Island City - Cool neighborhood, but not as cool as it thinks. Some of the apartments are overpriced, but if you can find a deal, it's a nice place.

It makes getting groceries so much easier - I'll just drive out to Queens where they have decent grocers and load up the car. No more of that waiting in cramped spaces. I also have two bulldogs, so it makes travel easier. And it's great to be able to get away for the weekend without too much planning. Even though most people don't have a car, traffic is still awful. You need to remember who you [share the road with](http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/m/x/mxk5088/cab_qjpreviewth.jpg) as taxis and buses cut you off with no signal. Plus, most of the people driving in the city are coming from either the outer boroughs, NJ, Westchester County or Long Island. A decent alternative may be [ZipCars](http://www.zipcar.com/nyc/find-cars).


And as for rent control goes, you can probably find a [rent stabilized apartment](http://theapplepeeled.com/renters/rent-stabilization-101-what-you-need-to-know/) where they're only allowed to increase the rent a certain percentage, but you will not find a rent controlled apartment. To qualify for rent control, a tenant must have been living continuously in an apartment since July 1, 1971. When vacant, the unit becomes rent stabilized. Thanks to this, I have friend who live on the Upper East Side in a three bedroom and only pay a couple hundred a month since it's technically still their grandparent's residence. Since it appears you don't have family here, you'll be SOL. I'd need to know more of your skills before I could recommend entry level jobs."

im not saying they're completely devoid of endurance training. they're proffessional athletes, obviously they are extremely fit and have a diverse training program. what i'm saying is that rugby players, in general, have far more endurance than your average football player, because they need it more. rugby requires more endurance than football. this is fact. you can't debate it.

&gt;In the game sure, but not for training purposes. You do realize they corss train the shit out of these guys right? I mean I knwo you don't know much about Gridiron but this just seems to fall under common sense.

you do realize there's more to it than just running, right? in rugby you're tackling people, getting beaten up, tackled, and stepped on. some even lift up their teammates during lineouts. the amount of energy the players need to endure 90 minutes of this is huge. even after getting thrown to the ground for the 100th time, a rugby player is expected to get up immediatly and run to the ball/ruck/whatever.

 in football, once you're tackled the game stops and you get up at your leisure. rugby players train to endure far more than football players. certainly in football individual plays may be more intense, but in the long run rugby will wear on you far more. hence, the rugby players will outlast the football players. you just can't compare the two here.

&gt;And plays don't work out perfectly and you have to adjust to the counter on both offense and defense.

there's a huge difference between slightly modifiying a single play that has gone awry and playing a full 90 minute game with no solid planning. that you'd even use this as a comparison is laughable.

&gt;Just like most Gridiron players.

again, there's an enormous difference between a play gone awry or a player adapting a play to suit the field conditions and an entire game played without any well defined plays.

&gt;Honestly you just don't have a clue how Gridiron football works which is probably why you don't enjoy it.

i don't enjoy it because it's maybe 10 minutes of actual sport. the rest of the time is spent watching replays, advertisements, referee deliberations, etc... it's fucking boring."

Shinjuku is indeed nerdy -- there are some awesome stores there, that you should just go into for the experience (I loved Tokyo Hands, as well as some of the whacked out manga shops 8 stories underground.)

Harajuku is awesome on weekends, although there are usually a lot of people gawping at the freaks.

Go to the imperial museum, it is worth a visit.  I thought the palace, on the other hand, was kinda lame -- just a moat and a wall.  If you're lucky, you'll catch a wedding at the Meiji shrine. 

For shopping, we brought home a shit-ton of nice, traditional Japanese art and handicraft.  For example, there is a place that is supposedly _the_ shop for noren (those cloth things you see above Japanese doorways) in Tokyo, you may need to research this as I don't have their card anymore.  If you can put out some cash, you'll also find beautiful calligraphy scrolls, that kind of thing.  Or maybe you just want retarded electronic pets (I did -- I really need to see if my magnetic octopus still works.)

Go to an Izakaya for drinks, they're fun and the bar food is usually very good.  And if it's full of Japanese, they'll flip if you speak it a bit.

Also, I love food, and my girlfriend (who was there on an exchange program) had some great recommendations for local, super-stupid-fresh sushi/sashimi places from her hosts, but that was years back and I wouldn't have a clue anymore where to send you.  Eat, eat, eat.

I'm very serious about the ryokan -- I don't know how it is now, but when we were there, they were a cheaper option than (very generic) hotels and really awesome.

Do you actually know anyone who gets these government services?  Do you know how much shit you have to eat to get the benefits, how much paperwork is required, how much of your damn day you have to spend sitting in the assistance office in front of a surly and disrespectful government worker bee?  Have you any idea what it's like trying to find a doctor who will *take* CHIP without looking down on you as a ""welfare mom""?  Have you considered that someone would have to keep the baby for the two and a half years of school that would be left for the college sophomore mom after the baby is born?  Who's signing up for that?  Grandma?  But what if grandma, y'know, works?  Lots of households are two-income these days.  Is grandma supposed to quit her job to take care of grandbaby?  Is it ethical for daughter to expect that of grandma?  How many people OWE this baby?  Or is the young mom gonna pay for childcare?

They celebrated when the younger one finally graduated to ""toddler"" daycare because that was a hundred-bucks-a-week savings.)  Childcare is damned expensive if you can't sponge off of your mother or your boyfriend's mother.  Is that going to be affordable on top of college?  And dorm living is going to be right out because you can't take your baby to the dorm.  So, apartment off campus OR living at home and commuting.  Yay expensive.  I'm sure there's plenty of money in the budget for an apartment.  Or for a car reliable enough to commute.  And of course the New Mom won't be too tired for the schlep back and forth to college, right?  The New Mom CAN file for child support from Baby Daddy, whom I presume is also a college student with jack shit for income for the next couple of years but maybe he will put his college education on hold and go to work to support the baby.  (He can always ""go back and finish his education later"", right?  Just like the girl can.  Right?  Fair's fair, isn't it?  *crickets chirping*)  And I'm sure that he would step in front of that bus because It's The Right Thing To Do for his girlfriend of two months and his unborn baby.

* I have a Master's in Software Engineering, and 3 years of experience.
* I work for a top American software company that has a large software lab in Dublin

Quality of life:

* I rent a room in a shared house, because the price of housing is too high. I refuse to pay more that 40% of my salary for renting (esp. in a ""provincial"" city like Dublin with very few to do except drinking - it's not as if it was London, Paris or New York). When I was a student, I got a 1 bed room apt in Germany for half the price I pay for a room in Dublin. 
Most single working people are ""forced"" to house share in Dublin, or get rip of by unacceptable rate, that's just outrageous in 2010!!!

* I do not own a car, too expensive and roads are of third-world quality.

* Public transportation is a joke. Just unreliable buses outside city center and buses route are very bad designed (making loops - no concept of hubs) , airport is not even deserved by a tram/train or metro. Just to show how absurd it is: there is a commuter train line passing just 3km away from the airport and deserving a small island town instead of the international airport! Also, no metro for a city of this size.

* I get my food in discount stores (Lidl). Normal stores in Dublin have just NO choice and are very expensive for extremely low quality. Better go to discount stores in that case.


Bottom line:
I had a better standard of living when I was a student in Germany with no resources than as a Software Engineer in a top company in Dublin. I just stay for the top job for now while trying to actively relocate. 

During the ""celtic tiger"" years, Irish gov preferred to speculate on house, rather than catching up on continental Europe (or even UK) in term of quality of life.

Just punch in your data from NYC and see how it compares with living in Ireland. Keep in mind that living in Dublin will be higher than the national average. 
Also useful if you're interested in what benefits you're entitled to and what tax rates you'll be paying is www.citizensinformation.ie.

I'm 22 I've lived in Dublin all my life and absolutely love it, but it is expensive. House prices will probably (only probably) continue to fall for at least another year, so renting may be a good bet starting out. 

Commuting by car is a nightmare and public transport varies from comprehensive to non-existent, depending on the area. A year long bus ticket costs €980 (c.$1300), but you can claim it against tax, so if you commute that way it'll most likely work out at €670 (if you're living by a tram line, their long term tickets are cheaper, for some inexplicable reason).Personally, I think the best option is cycling, if you're working in the city centre, 70-80% of the city will be close enough to cycle to in less than half an hour. The main point being that if you drive to work as it stands then you may not need to spend as much on gas as you think when you move over.

Eating out has become a LOT cheaper recently with lots of good restaraunts offering recession busting set menus. There's a large selection of places to go now that do a 3 course meal with tea/coffee for &lt;€25. Of course, I've no idea how that compares to NYC.

Public services, while probably better than the States, are way behind other European countries. A lot of medical services are means tested (eg if you don't qualify for a medical card, a check up with your GP will cost €50.) Public schools vary dramatically in quality and private schools cost anything up to €6,500. One major saving though will be college. 3rd level tuition is free, except for a ""registration fee@ of €2,500 and although this may be phased out soon due to budget cuts, reintroduced fees will still be somewhere around 10% of those charged in the US. That said, it's very hard to predict what will happen between now and the time your child (or children) actually start college.

All that said though, Dublin is fantastic place to live and has personality and atmosphere I haven't found anywhere else on my (admittedly limited) travels. Although Dubliners are perceived within Ireland as cold and stand-offish, it's consistently ranked one of the friendliest cities in the world (which gives you an idea of what the rest of the island is like!) For the most part, people here like strangers and visitors, are interested in their past and are willing to lend a hand whenever help is needed.

I hope that's some help and I haven't repeated too much that you might know already. If there's any other information you're interested in just let me know."
t3_bp2eu,AskReddit,1,0,2,NEGATIVE,0.9592577219009399,"&gt;Check out places like Dundrum, Milltown, Ranelagh, Rathmines, Goatstown. Thanks to the Luas, (Dublin tram system), these places are all within twenty minutes of Dublin city centre during the rush hour, and the house prices will be dramatically less than what you'd be paying in city centre locations like Spencer Dock or Ballsbridge.

I lived in Rathmines for a few years, and I live in the NYC area now.  I didn't find Dublin to be terribly expensive, but I was making good money off my investments at the time and was adjusting from NYC prices - Which were still higher than Dublin by a good bit.  If I wasn't out drinking on the weekends then my expenses were pretty reasonable.  I much prefer Dublin to NYC.  Quality of life.. frankly there is no comparison.  I moved back to the US for the money, no other reason.  

Stay out of the city centre.  Mass transit is good and you're commute time will be less than you are accustomed to here.  I don't know if you own a car now, but I never had one when I lived there.  I'd rent one for a few days if I was visiting family on the holidays or something, the rest of the time I was fine without.

Good luck to you on the move!"

You must not get a decent wage if 40% of your income cant get you a one bed apartment, considering I am looking at two double bedroom apartments in Dublin 4 (between ballsbridge and grand canal dock area) and we will probably pay about 1000 to 1100 a month for that (my budget is about 30% of my wages). You would definitely get a one bed apt for about 700-900 mark, this means you earn less than 2000 a month therefore imo you cant afford to live alone.

Yes our transport system is poor but it works alright, the bus corridors have speed up a lot of bus routes and the train and tram service is improving. i dont own a car and i get around fine, moved out to Dublin 15 for the next few weeks till i get my new place and I dot have a problem commuting to Town (35 mins in the morning). now its a bit of headache if i want to visit my friends in say Clontarf its two trains and maybe 80mins.

Good services are provided by competition. Neighboring blocks of a city might compete with each other for residents and commerce. But the model breaks down when we consider systems that can't easily find competition. The Manhattan subway system is an example. Is it supposed to be that if whoever controls the Manhattan subway system does a poor job, someone else is supposed to come in and build a new subway system from scratch to provide competition? Or is New York City competing with Chicago for residents and commerce? I don't really buy either model. Monopolies don't happen naturally for toothpaste companies, but for public transportation it's very hard NOT to have a monopoly on everything.

With utilities it's the same way. The water company lays the pipe and then owns all the pipe. Another company can't come in and compete without re-laying all the pipe again just to be able to compete. Just to have competition we have 3 sewer pipes going down below any major roadway, 2 of them ultimately unnecessary. Further, it's in any companies interest to try to limit competition as much as possible."
t3_bp301,politics,1,0,3,POSITIVE,0.9957019686698914,"A lot of people are making a good point that a national rail system (while a great idea) would be hugely inefficient and ineffective, if implemented now.

Right now, America's mindset is closed off to anything other than a automobile-focused transportation system. The best way to get people open to the idea of a train-based system would be to start locally- Start building and organizing cities around pedestrian/bike/subway traffic. NYC's subway system is incredible, I ride it every day, and the city is making legitimate attempts to make the city more foot- and cycle-friendly (bike lanes, walking plazas in Times and Herald Squares).  

Get more cities to revolve less around cars and more around mass transit, and you'll open more of America up to the idea of using things other than cars to get around, and pretty soon more people will be on board with national rail. Finally getting rid of my car and moving somewhere where I didn't need it (NYC) is one of the best decisions I've made in my life.

Edit: Just thought of this and wanted to say it before someone else called me on it: yes, cars will always still have a place in society. No, not all cities and towns would be feasible targets for this kind of social change. But most of the heavily populated areas and surrounding suburbs could use something like this."

No one is claiming that car2go is completely innovative either. The difference between car2go and other services is that you don't have to return the car to the same spot you picked it up at. That means you can take the bus to work, and if you happen to need to run an errand, you can just pick up a car and leave it at your destination. It's a much better complement to public transit than traditional carsharing services.

[Car2go cars can be taken out of the operating area, but the
rentals can not be closed until brought within the operating
area.](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.car2go.com/austin/en/res/operating_area.pdf) You can take the car wherever you want, though I remember reading something about a limit of around 250 miles or so. I can't find it at the moment.

Car2go has every other feature of Zipcar you've mentioned, except a variety of cars to choose from. Since there's no monthly fee, a variety of cars isn't an issue. If you need a truck, rent one. Also, I don't know how tolls are handled. All of the toll roads are in the suburbs anyway, so it's not really an issue like it would be in San Francisco or New York.

&gt; tl;dr Austin should have went with Zipcar and not this Car2go company.

Nothing the city has done prevents Zipcar from coming to Austin. They've just given car2go parking spaces, which they've given to other services like [Austin CarShare](http://www.austincarshare.org/), and they pay for city employees to use the cars for work purposes.

One day, I got onto a crowded subway in New York, but for some reason, there was an empty seat.

We weren't near a station, so I thought it was kind of weird, but I just kept reading. Then, the crowd of people part to let this man through. It was Bill Murray. He's wearing jeans, a t-shirt that has a huge stain on it, and a hat. He stares at me, then lies down on the seats next to me and puts his head in my lap and proceeds to go to sleep. I'm looking around because I can't believe that this shit is happening. Nobody seemed to care much, and Bill Fucking Murray had his head in my freaking lap. One guy next to us pulls out a 100 dollar bill and tells me that Bill Murray payed them to get up. Apparently he has been doing this all day.

t3_bodme,programming,2,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9951925277709961,"Apologies for implicitly bashing your username, but I'm not very familiar with lbzip2 or how popular it is, however, since only researchers (and probably some select software companies) will have access to Rock Creek, whether or not someone tests lbzip2 on it depends on if anyone in those positions finds it an interesting program to use/study. I suspect a lot of uses of Rock Creek will be trying to implement manycore implementations of ""important"" code (i.e., whatever the company or researchers find interesting), studying runtime systems, studying compilers, etc. etc.  It seems that lbzip2 is perfectly scalable and parrallelizable, so I'm not sure if it's a good thing to bother studying.

It is not at all clear exactly what support, if any, Rock Creek has for pthreads. They use words like ""memory coherence"", but I think that means unified address space more than cache coherent memory system (thus pthreads wouldn't work). I've heard mention that it doesn't have cache coherence hardware, but it wasn't clear to me if their runtime can fake cache coherence/shared memory using software.  Thus someone would have to port lbzip2 to whatever libraries they expect people to use (like MPI), which doesn't seem to be a particularly interesting research problem.

Regarding my opinion of that last paragraph, I don't understand what they mean by ""true shared memory test"".  I also didn't understand their reason why it wasn't a true shared memory test: cache coherence in any system outside of a bus processor will be point-to-point, i.e., direct message passing.  Also, shared memory and direct messaging are both ""Turing-complete"" communication systems - you can implement one given the other.  Can you explain what kind of opinion you were hoping to gather?"

one thing that makes a city is the **food.** as far as boston goes, hit up pizzeria regina in the north end (best pizza i have ever had), and j.p. licks (ice cream, i would suggest newbury st. location). chinatown is also worth a look - there is a lot of bubble tea and really authentic chinese food, and despite it being the dirtiest part of town it is still my favorite part of boston. a short walk away is boston common, and funnel cake/lemonade at the stands around the park st. subway stop are a must.

as far as tourist spots, i would suggest avoiding what tour books say and go with word of mouth, or the sort of stuff people mention here. like i said, there is boston common, our equivalent of central park. newbury st. and boylston st run parallel to each other, and end up hitting boston common. both have great shops and a really good vibe. prudential center (one entrance hits boylston st) is worth a look, but dont expect to find cheap shopping. fenway park is worth a visit, but only if you are big on the team. the ballpark is the only exciting thing in that area.

lastly, the river esplanade - it is a wonderful place for walk or run on a nice day. cross the mass ave bridge on foot and you get the best view of the city.

i could go on but im sure everything will get covered by other people here. in summation, my ultimate recommendation: wait for sunny weather, grab some food, and eat it out in the sun. we don't get warm weather a lot here, so unlike my home state (cali), people take to the outdoors when we get sun.

hope that helps!"

t3_bphzy,boston,4,0,3,POSITIVE,0.9569595456123352,"Ok, this is subjective. Personally, I think our transit system is *awesome* compared to others I have used. That said, Bostonian complain an awful lots about our transit system. 

Our train system is color coded. Red, Blue Green and Orange. There are 4 Green Lines - the B, C, and D and E.) This is the only line that also has letters.  Northeastern is assecible via the Green Line 'E' train, or the orange line 'Ruggles Station' stop. We call our Transit system the ""T"".

 www.mbta.com - visit this site for a visual. There are also real maps out there that overlays the T train map on it so you can actually see the real overview of the system. There are a few major hubs that connect the systems together. They are Park Street, Downtown Crossing (DTC), Government Center, State Street and South Station. 

Logan Airport is on the Blue Line at the 'airport' stop. You get on it right at the airport and ride it to whatever line you want to transfer to. For instance, coming from he airport, you will get on the Blue line, ride it to ""Government Center"" which is another station that connects you to the ""Green Line"". So you get off your train at GC and get onto a Green Line Train ""E"" train and ride it to the Northeastern T stop.  

OR, you could also take the Blue Line to  'State Street'. At State Street, you transfer to the Orange Line and ride that to 'Ruggles' Station, which is at Northeastern as well. 

And yes, I would definitely take the T. Cabs will run you over 20 to get into town because of tolls from the airport. The T is 2 bucks.

When I told you how to walk from Northeastern all the way to the North End, you would probably cover 5 or 6 T stops, but the walk only takes say...30 minutes? That is what I mean by a walking city. Sometimes it is honestly quicker and more enjoyable to walk from one area of town to another.

t3_bpkza,pics,3,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9978187084197998,"That's what they claim.  They also claim this is the first semester in 5 or 6 years that they've had the problem, which when averaged in, brings them down to the national average for universities.

_The last statement of this paragraph is redacted, which really makes this whole paragraph wrong.  See below comments_
I really would like, now, to rail against why that figure is a bit bogus, and if you read my other posts here, or the submission on the topic, maybe you can find more, but the truth is, this school seems to be pretty good, by comparison, on the issue.  At Cornell, when someone commits suicide, it tends to be really obvious.  Its often done in the gorges, which means someone will find the body later swimming with friends, or boating on the lake, and in a small (generally happy) town like Ithaca, something like this is hard to hide.  By comparison, if you're going to school in NYC, well, the NY Times is hardly going to start writing articles about suicide if 6 more suicides turn up in New York City, that may or may not have been the result of the universities there. 

The real problem, is that American universities have absolutely 0 forced investment in the well being of their worst off students.  You can read stories online about how 'potentially problem-ed' students were treated at VTech after their shooting.  I have a friend at NYU who experienced some awful stuff over a winter break, and one day, about a month into his semester come spring, was asked to meet with a teacher after class, whereupon he was ambushed by NYPD, and forcibly taken to a mental hospital... whereupon he had to prove to them he was in fact fine, just occasionally upset about the winter, before being released a day or two later.

Can you imagine how traumatizing it would be for an actual near-suicidal, or mentally problem-ed student to walk to a meeting to meet their professor, and be ambushed with handcuffs and a squad car... without telling the family?

But our universities aren't asked to help their students.  They are tasked with weeding out students who can't hack it in their major of choice (particularly true for engineering/medicine/etc).  And if some student does fall on hard times, the university is never attacked for not treating a student kindly enough.  Rather, they are lauded as preventing a school shooting or otherwise ensuring the safety of the rest of the student body, by forcibly removing at-risk students however they deem necessary.

So nationally, our universities are absolutely horrible at this sort of treatment.  Which is absurd too, because you know on an individual by individual level, the people at the universities want nothing more than to help their students (or else they wouldn't have taken jobs interacting as such).  Its just a general, systematic priorities thing.

Cornell, since its suicides get more attention, seems to try a little harder at helping students that seem to be at-risk (at least, compared to that NYU story i know.  that and all the Cornell PR I've heard these last few weeks that says so, though comments below call this into question).  I know if you ever show up particularly distressed one day to class around here, and then fail to keep an appointment later in the week, there's a really good chance that Cornell will send police out to look for you, and make sure you're okay.  Its actually kinda scary how effective they are at it, its happened to myself, and two people I know... but if you want to be affective against suicide, then that's the sort of ""outreach"" you're going to need.  I still think they have a completely bullshit psychology ward, and I'm still convinced that Cornell's official response to any at-risk student is ""expel them, or kick them off campus,"" and that they are completely to blame for the high rate here, and doubly so for deflating the actual statistics..... but this response is long enough, and I have work to do.

edit: Two jokes to leave with.

1) How many Cornell Engineers does it take to screw in a ligh-bulb?

A)  One to screw in the light bulb, one to crack under the pressure.

2)

* You look bummed out, so, are you enjoying yourself yet?

**Mobs**
* No fast zombies.  Seriously, stick to the classics...also this helps to avoid FPS-ishness.
* Bad guys would include zombies, feral animals, and various types of humans (thieves, gangs, rogue military or police, teabaggers)...okay, so that's somewhat unrealistic...teabaggers aren't human.


**The World**
* The world should be beautiful and green and starting to look overgrown (think anti-Fallout and many scenes from I Am Legend the movie)...no dustbowls, no excessive concrete and grey-ness, no crates or barrels to smash.  Zombies, old blood stains, scary old newspaper headlines, and repeating messages from the CDC will add atmosphere without excessive bleakness.  Silence broken by a scream, moan, or gunshot is scary enough.
* Have day and night cycles as well as seasons.
* Have servers be major cities and surroundings, but think outside the box...not New York or Vegas, but more along the lines of Pittsburgh (in obvious homage), Seattle, Cambridge (UK), and one or two other geographically diverse not gigantic cities.  They should have some landmarks, but otherwise be anywhere.


**Gameplay**
* Wherever you attempt to logout is given a safety rating; logout somewhere unsafe and you might log back on as a zombie.  There would have to be some benefit to doing this right, sort of like the anti-xp debt that City of Heroes offers, but also no bonus, penalty, or possibility of death for disconnects or crashes.
* All deaths result in zombification, wih zombification acting as a death penalty that allows you to go PVP, death-by-zombie acts as the longest death penalty (several hours of in-game time, or 1 day or so of logged-off time).
* Classes would be generalized (Shooter, Melee-er, Medic, Jack-of-All, etc), but would have a lot of different skills specific to the class.
* Sub-Skills would include hard-choice items, where you can only choose 1, like water purification, weapon maintenance, scrounging, gardening, hunting, first aid, mechanics, building.  This would encourage teaming, trading, and exploring, but still allow people to turtle if that's their inclination.
* Leveling is standardized through missions, killing mobs, and accomplishing community tasks or trading.
* Trading is a viable profession with higher rewards based on how far you travel from home base to trade post.
* Driving can be part of the game...cars, boats, horses, segways...why not?  But fuel is scarce and pricey.  Not to mention, most modes of transportation would attract mobs.


**Fort Play**
* Homeowning requires A) you clear out a place, and B) to fortify it...give it a simplified Sims-like interface and people will play with just that for much longer than is considered healthy :)
* Larger building (schools, grocery stores, police stations) require large numbers of owners.
* Exceptionally large facilities (military bases, Costco, shopping malls) would basically be guilds, with a maintenance requirement to fend off bandits and zombies, but with the additional benefit of NPCs showing up over time and based on achievements (like holding off zombies or bandits for x days, or staying fed and hydrated).
* Some missions would allow you to save / rescue NPCs which would allow you to upgrade to larger dwellings with the NPC as a live-in.

**Motivations**
* You need to eat and drink to maintain peak performance, and well-sated can result in buffs, like potions.  Logging out for extended time can bring you to peak health if you're bad at getting food or water.
* You need to explore and do missions to get better equipment and fort materials (shot guns, rifles, ammo, solar panels, grow lights...duh...for the garden).
* Equipment would be based off of real stuff, but maybe include some future tech like you might see on Discovery or some other science show (high level stuff might be prototype body armor or bioengineered seeds).

Let's face it....on our budget (I live in a $1400 2 bdrm right now; it's a RR or I would say you can have it!) we aren't going to live in a hot spot. Often, how much you like your apartment all comes down to how shitty your train line is. For this reason, I like to live either by a really sweet train line OR I like to live near a bunch of options. 

* *JMZ* * I have heard the JMZ is no longer scary, at least through Bushwick, so if you're comfortable taking that you are going to have a lot of options. I would definitely keep Myrtle as my last stop though....otherwise shit is going to get too real/too far away.

* *L* * I think unfortunately you're not going to find much before the Morgan stop. You might be able to get something at Jefferson, but the ability to tag everything on the L as Williamsburg seems to have driven up prices. 

* *4/5 2/3* * The 4/5 2/3 connection, on the east side of Prospect Park covers the Prospect Heights/Crown Heights area. While Crown Heights sucks and has virtually no neighborhood feeling, you'd be close to 4 express trains, which has got to have its perks.

* *F* * The F serves Park Slope, so if you like to hang out there and only there, you can live in Windsor Terrace, which is MAD FAR AWAY but is filled with middle income white people and has a neighborhood feel some people seem to like.

* *Q/R* * This will take you to Bayridge and Sunset Park---apparently nice places to live although no hipsters know that yet. I personally have had no reason ever to go there.

* *G* * I think everyone pretty much agrees that the G is completely absent on the weekends and isn't really any good unless you have another train line to rely on. However, I don't think you'll find a place in Greenpoint and I'm pretty sure Fort Greene is going to be out of your price range.


Neighborhoods specifically:

1. Bed Stuy -- You are going to find a lot of places here. I personally don't have any desire to live here because I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb. However, quite frankly, if you are respectable and don't come home drunk really early in the morning, you will probably be okay here. I know friends who have had backyards here. However, the A/C is a long, stupid ride and often includes a transfer to a shuttle.

2. Pratt -- A lot of places with Bed Stuy prices and a little of the comfort feeling of a college campus. Cons.....lots of drunk students hanging around all the time. But this seems like it could be a good bet for you. 

3. Fort Greene -- Of course, this neighborhood is beautiful and awesome. Here's a link to an [affordable apt.](http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/abo/1688349820.html) Do I believe that apt is real? No, not really.

tl;dr.....Sorry I'm sort of rambling at this point, but here's what I think:

1. Being open to living on the G will get you a good deal, [possibly](http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/abo/1686621651.html)
2. Being open to living in Bed Stuy will get you a good deal
3. I bet if you looked around Pratt you would find something
4. There's got to be something in Bushwick that works for you---although that neighborhood, if you can call it that, lacks grocery stores and other amenities
5. If you're interested in saving money, really finding a good situation with a nice place, try unknown/unpopular neighborhoods like Sunset Park

Also, I'm happy to keep talking about this.

t3_bpo2u,food,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9659016728401184,"When I was young I had a few foods that I really didn't like, and at a certain point I decided to train myself to eat them so I wouldn't miss out on dishes that included those ingredients. (I found yellow squash and raw tomatoes particularly repulsive.)  

I had a realization that helped with this process:  Much of the negative reaction I experienced when eating something ""disgusting"" had little to do with the actual flavor of the item. It was mostly a vicious cycle of negative expectations feeding back into the experience. First you see it and think about how you don't like it, and you brace yourself for a negative experience. Then you taste it and confirm that, yes, it is indeed that thing that I hate (combined with memories of earlier bad experiences.)  

So what you have to do is turn off all of those reactions and make yourself experience the food directly, with no expectations, as if for the first time. If it's something you've convinced yourself you really hate, it may take some effort to keep clearing your mind of the ""disgust"" reaction and returning to the Zen direct experience of the flavor/texture/etc.

This mental technique worked well for me, and over the years I learned to actually enjoy all of the foods that I had found disgusting as a child. I've also discovered (now that I'm willing to try things repeatedly that I don't immediately take to) that often I'll have to try a new food or drink multiple times before I like it, but sometimes those ""challenging"" flavors become big favorites after the third or fourth attempt. Guinness Stout would be a good example of that. So if I was unwilling to keep trying things, I would be missing out on many of my current favorite things. "

That is an evil act reserved for feminists and mean people and is, like, a total violation of free speech. r/MR is committed to unhypocritical airing of views, as their constant chainlinking of Reddiquette and complaints about misandrist downvoting indicate.)

Men's Studies and studies of masculinity have been a part of gender studies programs for some time. They're chiefly a part of a series of phenomena that have arisen in academia over the last two decades- along with queer theory- that have precipitated the shift from ""Women's Studies"" to ""Gender Studies"" or ""Women and Gender Studies"" (the latter being the title at my own school). But their relative academic novelty is not a reason to discount the value of these approaches.

That said, ""Male Studies"" is a bit like Intelligent Design, reactionary ideology dressed in the patina of science and academia with the intent of pushing a popular, hegemonic viewpoint in an area where it does not hold much sway. In the case of creationists, despite controlling the cultural life of rural America they needed to breach the one bastion of the schooling of secular science: public schools.

In the case of the extremist men's rights activists who push ""Male Studies"" it's an attempt to legitimise in the academy an already dominant cultural conception of manhood that is trumpeted from every other corner of society.

&gt;“There are some fundamental features of ideological feminism over the last 30 or 40 years that we need to question.” 

As per usual most critics don't seem to have interacted with much that was feminist save for caricatures and third hand readings of the most controversial feminists as told through the mainstream media.

It's hard to find people more critical of feminism than feminists themselves. The aforementioned ideological shift in the scope of feminist and gender studies was the result of many long and drawn out battles within feminism. Its Left wing and academic roots make it very fractitious indeed, one of feminism's greatest strengths and weaknesses.

In sum, critiques of feminism- particularly of Second Wave feminism- are *commonplace* both in gender studies classrooms and in the literature.

However, particular attention is increasingly being paid to how feminism marginalised women of colour, adopted a bourgeois/middle-class perspective and tacitly pretended this was a total perspective, and was deeply oppressive to transsexual people. I seriously doubt Male Studies is in any way interested in these far more damaging elements of feminism's less pleasant history. Feminism has not, as they are trying to imply, turned (white, cis) men into an oppressed class.

&gt;If the female-favoring gender gaps in postsecondary enrollment and graduation rates damaged a group other than males, “there would be an outcry.” 

Yes. Except, let us say post-postsecondary enrolment and graduation rates show the opposite. Female PhDs, fewer in number as they are, barely make more than male bachelor degree holders. Women are also vastly outnumbered in the schools and fields that lead to high paying jobs.

Secondarily, without going into overmuch detail, the current issue of men being underenrolled in undergraduate education is not the result of some wave of feminist discrimination in education, as is often implied, but social and economic forces that have just begun to take their toll, so to speak. Many blue collar labour jobs, unionised or not, did not- and still don't- require college degrees. Many of these jobs, whether as dangerous as mining or as relatively safe as bus driving, are dominated by men and present themselves as a viable economic alternative to larger groups of men than they do to women.

In order for us to make the same amount (again, speaking in very general terms here) we're much more under pressure to gain the economic advantage of a college degree.

This holistic analysis is lost on these people who grope at any statistical disparity without any explanation to claim some type of male oppression (suicide rates are the other biggie here, a matter to which I'll return in brief below).

&gt;Heasley, of the men’s studies group, said that much of what male studies’ supporters are propagating is untrue, or at least not the whole story. “These are really unfounded claims that are being made,” he said. “It’s kind of a Glenn Beck approach.”

A very apt comparison indeed.

The reactionary comments on this very article in Inside Higher Ed- comprised of names I recognise, the same five people who flood any internet news article or blog post about an MRA pet issue, it seems- illustrate the reality of this; the blatant misuse of context-less statistics is one thing that would do Fox News proud for sure. For example:

&gt;Men are 98% of war dead

I'm not sure any reasonable person actually believes this when one factors in (often uncounted, due to either impossibility, inaccessibility, or racism) civilian deaths. 98% of people in uniform, maybe. But who is it that keeps women from making up half of our soldiery? Not feminism. The gender norms that argue national security would be compromised by female participation in war are all patriarchal and traditional in nature.

You're not going to find many pomo justifications of this imbalance.

&gt;Men are 80% of all suicides

[The assertion that this is an unknown fact is fatuous at best.](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/suicide-in-the-us-statistics-and-prevention/index.shtml#risk) As is the idea that men are some 'great ignored' when it comes to the issue of suicide. However, one deeply compassionate MRA has gone on the record as saying- when confronted with the fact that more women *attempt* suicide- that our inability to follow through meant that women did it for attention (i.e. to manipulate men) rather than actually kill themselves. It's quite clear, at least to me, that there's not any *real* compassion for victims or survivors of suicide. Just more groping at percentages for rhetorical value.

This leaves aside the fact that suicide is a very intensely studied phenomenon. A comprehensive analysis of suicide is one of the foundational works in the discipline of sociology. Ironically, however, what consistent research has shown is that the more prosperous one is, the more likely one is to be socially anomic and without complex social connections, bonds, and networks. Thus, rich people have higher rates of suicide than the poor by far.

Are they secretly oppressed?

One could go on. ""Male Studies"" is little more than a trojan horse for right wing ideology. It does not help men in any real sense. The supposed effort to understand the ""male as male"" (as opposed to what? The male as the Tooth Fairy?) is a thinly veiled attempt at the promotion of old guard John Wayne style masculinity.

The very thing that sires male gendered oppression."

You still need a car to get to work, so you can make money.

They still need people to work on these technologies to power the stuff that will be need to build these alternative energys, yes they will be built but people wont build them if they cant get to work to get money so they can buy this stuff so they can keep going to work,

it costs $20000 to convert your home to solar if its new much more if your home is old,  wind farms need huge open spaces  and they cost alot so they need money to be built, they are being built but what are people going to spend money on gas to get to work in a car they are still paying for or are they going to pay for another car while still paying for the car they already have and have no money to spend on anything else,

This whole thing is going to fuck up alot of people they should have started years ago but they didnt now they are going to pay for it by not being able to afford these alternative power sources.

These electric/hydrogen cars are 50k+ that does charge in 45 minutes and can go 300 miles, a normal person cannot afford that currently and they are not willing to buy a smaller car that is alot less but cannot go very far and takes 16 hours to charge,

Also growing more fuel needs fuel so we can power the tractors and it barely makes enough to be usefull,

We need this dirty power to build these clean ones but no one seems to be thinking of that, 

But i really belive we have to stop using this dirty fuel on stupid shit and use it to build these cleaner power stations now, 

Almost every car/truck/plane/train in the states/most of the world runs on gasoline/other type of fuel oil, 

Alternative energys currently are not making enough energy to make the other alternative energy systems we need, we have a oil shortage the fuel left over is not going to go to building these as much as we are today.


We need to be able to convert the cars we have into hydrogen/electric cars not buy brand new ones because people cannot afford buying a brand new car, we need to use less energy and lower the costs of these alternative energys so people will build them, they could easyily be included in the price of a new home instead of having it as a option force it on people, people are not going to just do this stuff we will have to force people to switch, 

Its all about money, it will cost nearly 10 trillion dollars to convert 600000 homes/3 states worth of homes""not including factorys or businesses"" to use wind at the current cost and about 280 billion dollars to build solar to power the same amount and the wind power requires a area the size of the state of New york to have them in""which means alot of trees cut down, and they cannot be located near citys/towns""

&gt;The Honda Leaf will charge in 45 minutes, and travel 300 miles/charge.

Hydrogen fuel cells are much more effective take 3 minutes to fuel up and the power station is in the car and the car does not have to be smaller/lighter meaning more people will buy them.

Growing fuels is a bad idea takes up more space most of the fuel made goes back to growing the fuel.


We need to make these things cheaper and force them on people even if we make it 5000 to convert your home to solar, people wont do it because they would rather have a flatscreen tv or a pool.

I agree with you we need these alternative energys but it'll take time and oil fuels to make these alternative systems.

Well, there's 

&gt; But look more closely at some of the longest-running data about school trends, and the picture that emerges isn't so neatly polarized—or so readily PET-scanned, either. The truth is that by 1980, women had already reached parity with men on college campuses. Over the next two decades, as women continued to get college degrees in ever greater numbers, there's evidence to suggest that girls' gains at the pre-college level weren't as striking and don't appear to have been at the expense of boys. A paper titled ""Assessing Gilligan vs. Sommers"" surveyed ""gender-specific trends"" in the well-being of American children and youths between 1985 and 2001 by, among other things, assembling National Assessment of Educational Progress test scores for reading and math skills over the decade and a half—for ages 9, 13, and 17. The graphs that emerged aren't very exciting: The trend is relative stability for all, rather than marked mobility for either gender. Boys' reading scores have declined somewhat over the past decade, but they were lower than girls' from the start; girls' scores have barely budged. Meanwhile, math scores have risen slightly for both girls and boys. Gender gaps are negligible for 9- and 13-year-olds, while high-school boys hold a slight edge over their female peers. The percentage of females between 18 and 24 with high-school diplomas, too, held steady—at about 85 percent; in 2001, the percentage of males with diplomas dropped slightly below what had been a pretty stable 80 percent.

&gt; Other complaints about boy-averse pedagogy also don't quite add up—in part because they contradict one another. Sommers blamed a touchy-feely, progressive ethos for alienating boys in the classroom; males, she argued, thrive on no-nonsense authority, accountability, clarity, and peer rivalry. But now Newsweek blames roughly the opposite atmosphere for boy trouble: the competitive, cut-and-dried, standardized-test-obsessed (and recessless) pedagogical emphasis of the last decade. So much speculative certainty doesn't really shed much light on the puzzle of what's deterring young men from college.

&gt; minority and poor males lag furthest behind, especially in college attendance. (Black women now receive twice as many college degrees as black men.) Gender equity may be the sexier goal to push for, but right now socioeconomic inequality is the greater obstacle to overcome.

and

http://www.springerlink.com/content/q21n637166321223/







&gt; But those problems are hardly so widespread. The alarming statistics on which the notion of a crisis is based are rarely broken out by race or class. When they are, the whole picture changes. It becomes clear that if there is a crisis, it's among inner-city and rural boys. White suburban boys aren't significantly touched by it. On average, they are not dropping out of school, avoiding college or lacking in verbal skills. Although we have been hearing that boys are virtually disappearing from college classrooms, the truth is that among whites, the gender composition of colleges is pretty balanced: 51 percent female and 49 percent male, according to the National Education Association. In Ivy League colleges, men still outnumber women.

&gt; One group of studies found that although poor and working-class boys lag behind girls in reading when they get to middle school, boys in the wealthiest schools do not fall behind, either in middle school or in high school. University of Michigan education professor Valerie Lee reports that gender differences in academic performance are ""small to moderate.""

&gt; When it comes to academic achievement, race and class completely swamp gender. The Urban Institute reports that 76 percent of students who live in middle- to higher-income areas are likely to graduate from high school, while only 56 percent of students who live in lower-income areas are likely to do so. Among whites in Boston public schools, for every 100 males who graduate, 104 females do. A tiny gap.

&gt; But among blacks, for every 100 males who graduate, 139 females do. Florida's graduation rates among all students show a striking picture of race and class: 81 percent for Asians, 60 percent for whites, 48 percent for Hispanics and 46 percent for blacks.

I've always really loved Spain, and my wife has always really loved Italy (we're both young, and have backpacked several times together and apart).  I've found Norther Europe / Scandinavia / Germany / France not as much fun, and far more expensive (with the exception of certain cities that are more difficult / time-consuming to get to).  My favorite memories are almost entirely of Spain, Italy, Austria, and Ireland.

Another point... it's important to mix medium sized cities in there.  The big cities are just that: big and overwhelming.  The more manageable sized cities help restore a sense of relaxation.  Speaking of which... schedule some time out!  Take a day, every 10-14 days at the most, and take the day off.  No sites, at all.  Just sleep late, do laundry, go to a park and read.  My first trip I hit Barcelona at the end of week five after going full-out on a jam-packed itinerary... and I just blew a gasket.  I slept about 18 hours, two days in a row... and barely saw any of the city.

Paris Hostel: it's just that the quality of hostels, overall as a city, is lower.  They may not be the worst you see in Europe, but it's an overall trend - you can find decent ones.  Lucky Youth is good, and I've also stayed at Young and Happy in the Latin Quarter.  Y&amp;H was pretty decent... older building w/ small rooms, but clean and a great location (Paris is all about location, consider splitting time between two hostels on either side of the river).

Eating: good plan.  Definitely try to budget a few meals you can go out and enjoy... part of travel is experiencing the cuisine!  Although, experiencing cuisine doesn't mean you have to go to an expensive bistro... there's plenty of common-folk food that will give you a unique flavor for the country too.

They are like 2-3 Euro each... but 2-3 mini-sammies makes a meal.  That, and a glass of wine, might set you back 12 Euro or so... but that's not much, and it's totally a unique and amazing place!  And where else can you eat local food, at a fair price, in the same restaurant Kafka used to go to?!

The drinking, it depends where you go.  At night, especially on weekends, in Madrid... it's a very common thing for youth to do in the parks.  However, Barcelona is more about the bar-hopping tapas scene.  Likewise, in Paris on the weekends... it's not a picnic without wine.  I remember one evening sitting up on Montmartre near Sacre Coeur and drank some cheap French beer.  (a 40oz no less, I think it was the 1664 brand?  I was pretty impressed given the stigma of cheep *French* beer.)  Anyway, just use your judgment, things aren't as restrictive as in the US, so if you're keeping a low profile and not acting up, foreign police won't want to bother with all the paperwork if it's just a misdemeanor.

If I were with you and trying to show you around... here's what I would do:

Madrid &gt; Seville &gt; Grenada &gt; Barcelona &gt; Nice &gt; Cinque Terra &gt; Rome &gt; Venice &gt; Vienna &gt; Budapest &gt; Prague &gt; Berlin &gt; Amsterdam &gt; Bruges &gt; Paris &gt; Madrid

Notes: it may be easier to go to Seville and Grenada, then return to Madrid before moving on.  Similarly, it may be easier to go from Vienna to Budapest, then back through Vienna.  You could do Barcelona on your way *back into* Spain instead of your *way out*.

One last big note: I would try to plan some flexibility into your trip.  This is difficult to do during summer hostel season... places WILL book up a month or two in advance.  But if you can grab a last-second Ryan Air (or other budget airline) deal... I would suggest using budget airlines to bounce around.  Certain cities (Berlin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Ibiza) are just AWESOME... but too difficult to visit.  Flying is the only viable way.  Plus, it lets you eliminate longer train rides.  For example, from Paris to Madrid (in your initial itinerary) or Berlin to Paris (in my revision) are long hauls!  Either will take 6+ hours, unless you do a sleeper train (which btw, you need to do at least once).  Anyway, what if you could fly Berlin to Dublin (spend 2-3 days there) then to Paris, and it only cost 50 Euro?  HELL YES that's the best option, and it's realistic!  If you need to cover a lot of ground to see something you want to see, consider a flight or two to help not waste a day on a train."

#1 Take the MSF course. Most states off them for free or very cheaply. Private ones have beater bikes that you can learn on and drop.
#2 ALWAYS wear your gear - gloves, jacket, helmet, and jeans/pants no matter how short or familiar the ride is.
#3 NEVER drink and ride, even a single beer lowers your coordination and reaction time enough to make a bad situation a fatal one.
#4 Don't ride over your head. If your friends are going too fast, meet them at the destination
#5 Expect the unexpected. Your mind should be focused on one thing... the ride
#6 ABS saves lives, even if the purists tell you ""they don't like the feel"" its like not wearing a condom because you don't like the loss in sensitivity. Well life gets a lot worse than that :o)

I'm relatively young in years - 29, only licensed for 3, but I ride 15k miles a year or more so I've been around the block, NYC commuter every day year round, Montana, Wyoming, West Virginia, the works. I started with a Kawasaki Versys 649 CC and upright for visibility and comfort and have since moved on to a BMW 1150GS. I personally think its always better to learn in the dodge neon - Honda civic of motorcycles before you buy the Ferrari (Ninja,Ducati,CBR etc) or the f250 (Harley, Victory, Vulcan). All bikes ride differently, no insult intended on those comparisons, but if you drive an SUV before you learn how to corner, you're rollover rate is high. A similar trend can be seen in motorcycle accidents when your equipment is more powerful than you understand and are capable of dealing with. A blip of the throttle on a powerful bike will turn a perfect turn into a nasty road rash slide in a split second. Cant happen to you? what if you hit a bump and your wrist has a mind of its own as you struggle to stay in control?

LA's Metro is clean, on time, and efficient. I'm speaking from experience- I've lived in NY, Philly, DC, and London before moving here earlier this year.

The trains don't go enough places yet but they will.  Remember that 1/2 cent sales tax increase that passed last year? Well its going towards building [*$40 Billion* of transit improvements](http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2010/03/01/how-feasible-is-antonio-villaraigosas-3010-gambit-for-los-angeles-transit/) over the next 30 years, possibly in just 10 years if the Mayor can convince the Federal government to give LA a bridge loan. The new lines include:

-Green line extension to LAX
-Green line extension to Torrance
-Expo line (Downtown to Santa Monica via Culver City)
-Purple Line Extension (Downtown to Santa Monica via Westwood)
-Gold Line Foothills extension
-Gold Line Eastside extension
-Crenshaw Line
-I-405 Line
-Orange Line Extension
-Downtown Regional Connector (connects Blue + Expo Lines with Gold Lines)

LA was late to the metro game, but they are catching up rapidly. No other city in the country has a transit plan that's this aggressive.  In 10 years the city will be unrecognizable.

In the meantime, the buses really aren't that bad.  They go *everywhere*, and have an intelligent numbering system (e.g. The 20 is the local bus down Wilshire Blvd, the 720 is the Rapid version of the same bus, and the 920 is the super-Rapid version that makes no stops between Downtown and Santa Monica).

OP- I hope this info helps.  I had the same questions when I moved here from DC and it worked out just fine. I should say though, it does make a big difference where you live.  I'm a mile from a stop on the Red Line, and a short bus ride from Union Station.  I'm sure I might have a different perspective if I lived in the Westside where they have much less transit and much more traffic."

t3_bqqxv,reddit.com,53,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.8294894695281982,"I will not downvote you, but I will share my recent experience in the Philippines.

People there work their butts off, and average daily wage is $4-7.  That's around $1600 a year if you never take a day off.

It's easy to think that stuff is cheaper there, and some stuff is.  T-shirts were about $1.50 and we had a tasty steak dinner for $5.  That's good in comparison to what we have, but just think, your daily wage could buy 2-3 t-shirts.  That's the equivalent to about $30 a day in the US.

Fast food is approximately the same price it is in the US, but lower quality.  So you'd work all day just for one mediocre McDonald's meal.  Obviously most people don't eat a lot of fast food.

Living conditions? Most people live in dirt-floored huts with tin or shabby wooden walls, sometimes with 3 or 4 generations of family all in the same house, often sleeping on thin mats rather than beds.  

The thing that struck me most is not that they were so poor, but that it was so *normal* there.  They all had jobs and places to go, tons and tons of traffic (though rather than cars most people ride cheap little motorbikes with sidcars or hop on their equivalent of a bus that blows diesel smoke in their face the whole ride).. and they don't seem to think anything of it.

In places like the US and Europe we are rich beyond most of our comprehension.  If you own a car you are in the top 8% wealthiest people in the world!  I own a respectable home, nothing super fancy, but after going there I have stopped saying it's not my dream home, because it's way better than most people's dream homes and I am a dick for wishing for even more.

Also for perspective, aside from buying a whole lot of pretty nice baby clothes at a department store there, I did not at all feel like a ""rich American"" when it came time to buy things, particularly food, and I make in a day what they make in a month.

I do agree that for many of them that's the best work they can get, but don't fool yourself into thinking that it's somehow a reasonable wage based on their economy.  They're SUPER poor, even in their own country.  But that's life, and they deal with it.

It's also why sometimes whole villages will save up to send a single person to college and off to the US to work, where he will send back half his weekly paycheck and make a noticeable improvement in the living situation of that village.

I definitely recommend a trip to a country like the Philippines for everyone to get a little perspective on the world.

EDIT: I found this link about average wages in the Philippines: http://www.worldsalaries.org/philippines.shtml

The highest thing listed is $ 1,253 a month (about $5 an hour) for an airline pilot."

In any event, it used to have a video online and you could see people making motherboards. Apart from the higher technology used, it looked pretty much the same as these pictures. It is pretty hard to tell anything from still pictures. Obviously, this kind of work is repetitive and mindnumbing. That is what is done in China instead of the US in the first place. US workers would demand a premium to work reliably at that kind of job. Naturally, they wouldn't work 90 hours a week, but we have no real factual basis to believe that the Chinese workers do either.

The ""report"" were just words on a page created by an advocacy organization. Does this organization have a reputation for integrity and fairness in their investigations and reports? I don't know, and I'm not going to take it on faith.I will assume from the pictures that they were there, although we all know that's not necessarily true. In any event, I would have preferred interviews. Even then you have to rely on the translator. In the New York Times interviews at least one or two of the interviewees spoke enough English so that you could tell the New York Times is not just making up stuff, exaggerating, failing to be impartial, etc.Very early on, it says that the workers were not allowed to leave the factory except during regulated periods. Okay, they leave the factory and never come back. Period. End of story.

I actually watched a series of videos of Chinese workers by either the New York Times. The complaints, more like observations, were not about working conditions per se. More that they missed their hometown and family, lack of job security, downturn in the world economy affecting them directly, pay (particularly as regarded overtime and bonuses),  it was expensive living in a big city where the work opportunities were, and basic questions like whether it was worth making the extra money but feeling alienated and isolated. Pretty much what you would expect from an agrarian nation undergoing a literally unprecedented transformation to an urban first world country. Do I think that working conditions in China can be harsh compared to the US? Of course. I would very much like to know the specifics. However, I remain underwhelmed by the pictures and report by National Labor Committee. Apart from the somewhat staged looking at sleeping on the job pic, these pictures could have come from a small business in the US.

t3_bqvcm,environment,7,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9983349442481995,"Thanks for the analysis wesmwatson but I think the problem is the ""drill-baby-drill"" people don't believe the proven reserves figure.  They think there are billions and billions of barrels of oil under the water off the Atlantic and in Alaska under ANWR.  The scientific data does not support this but I don't think science has ever proven to be an impediment to a Palin supporter.

I don't work in the energy industry but for a service firm for energy firms and my read is that even when they open drilling everywhere in the USA, the energy producers will go slowly (except in the eastern Gulf where they know there is a lot of gas).   It's damned expensive to produce oil from 2,000 feet and unless oil is guaranteed to stay above $80, the producers won't take the risk.  As long as cheap oil flows in from Canada and Mexico, those leases will remain empty.

The new CAFE (if it stands) will reduce demand such that no U.S. producer will undertake a major discovery push in the Atlantic for decades and decades even if they could drill in Boston harbor.

Now look for shale gas to change the dynamic for petroleum dramatically.  In 10 years we could be driving natural gas (reformed either into diesel or some alcohol derivative).  We may not need nearly as much petroleum oil if we could meet 30% of our transportation needs with natural gas derived liquid fuels.  I'm not talking LPG cars, I mean real fuel from a pump at a station.  It takes a lot of natural gas but at $5 per Mbtu, it would be cheaper than refining $100 WTI.

We'll be drilling baby...just not in the Atlantic.  We'll be drilling and pumping the Marcellus and Barnett for the rest of our lives.

[Picture is from this site. There are a bunch more photos at the bottom.](http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/stations?5:979)

Basically it's the old City Hall station that they shut down because it was old and for security reasons (it's directly under City Hall.)

However, I've read in a number of places that it acts as the 'loop' for the 6-train. Since Brooklyn Bridge is the last stop on the 6 train, everyone exits and then the train continues into a tunnel and reappears about 2 minutes later on the uptown side of the tracks.

I'm wondering, if you were sneaky and careful and just stayed on the train when they told you to exit, would you be able to see it?

EDIT: FOR EX., when recording drums for lets say a basic folk/pop/rock song you really want every snare drum hit to be fairly the same, and in the same place of the drum so there is no radical difference between tone/timbre/volume. When I do a session on the drums depending on the song, I try to do this, and when I go into the room to listen to my take I can instantly on the 1st listen hear any snare drum hit I miss slightly, and say to the producer that in the 2nd measure of the 2nd pre-chorus beat 4 the snare is off pout a marker there and either fly in a good hit or I will overdub now.

t3_bqpy9,science,2,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9374935626983643,"&gt; Real interesting about the cooling bias from badly placed weather stations, however that is unacceptable imo.

Unfortunately, scientists have to deal with the weather stations that actually exist, rather than those they wish had existed for long periods of time. However, there are ways to validate the data to get a good bound on what biases may exist:

   * Do the datasets show that windy days are cooler than warm ones? If the data is infected by the urban heat island effect, you'd expect to see this; my understanding is that this is not observed.
   * Are days and nights warming significantly differently? (Same reason)
   * Do satellites, which obviously don't have the same siting issues, show different trends than ground stations? (They do not, though satellite data is not exactly the same as surface data and has only been around for 30 years; but despite this, they line up well).
   * Do oceans show warming in line with what could be expected? (Yes, though since no direct comparison is possible, this is rather weaker evidence)

As for the models, many of them are [open source](http://data.giss.nasa.gov), but I have yet to see any real analysis showing that they contain major errors (no skeptic I've met online has ever been able to point me to anything peer-reviewed, though that doesn't mean it doesn't exist). 

And ultimately, things like that are why I believe in the mainstream science. If it were really so uncertain, there should be studies showing alternative modern temperature records, alternative paleoclimate records, physics-based models that don't show warming, etc etc. As far as I can tell, these alternate studies simply don't exist. What little ""skeptic"" research is peer-reviewed tends to be criticisms of fairly small parts of the science; when I see those same authors trumpeting things on their websites they can't get past peer review (or worse, misrepresenting their own research), I smell a rat."

t3_bquuu,Libertarian,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9336897730827332,"&gt;Ah... good point. In the two cases where two friends (one conservative, one liberal) really argued this, only the husband worked. But there were other people involved in the ""friendly"" debate who were married and both worked.

One of the biggest problems, and ironies, of the tax code that the liberals support is that it hurts liberal areas the most.  The high income and urban states have higher costs of living that partially offset their higher income, yet the tax code does not take this into account at all.  So some New Yorker making $250,000 is paying through the nose at both the federal and state level while some rich man in MI gets the same lifestyle at $120,000 and it is [subsidized](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2165/2994934040_030a9f8ffb_o.gif) by the city slicker's tax payments and the whole time the MI guy is railing against government.

It truly is a wacky system that we have.  Personally I support a relatively flat tax with no deductions, exemptions, credits or other nonsense.  I would be open to a flat tax with a few different thresholds, say 10% up to $50,000 and 20% thereafter or something, but the important thing is to get rid of all of the complexity and social engineering.

&gt;It's funny because, while I have no idea how much they pay in taxes, my super-liberal father always says how he is more than happy to pay taxes because it is necessary for the ""betterment of others."" He is retired now but never made close to $250k a year.

At least your father is not a hypocrite.  My primary opposition to high taxation does not come out of sympathy for the rich losing their Ferraris and champagne, though all things being equal I do feel as though they deserve these things if they earn them.  I think that the primary reason that a society to allow them to have their wealth in peace is because it is the most efficient way to run an economy.

I do not doubt the motives of those that would redistribute income in most cases, they truly mean well.  What I believe that they are missing though is all of the unseen negative effects of their actions cumulatively add up to more harm than the very apparent benefit.  For example you can pass a law raising minimum wages, but in many cases you are going to increase unemployment.  Sure it is nice for those at the lower end who are still employed to get more money, but it is far worse for those on the margin that lost their job to go from some money to no money.  A similar argument is that all of the humanitarian aid to Africa is what is keeping it locked into poverty for so many decades because it [props up terrible governments](http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2009/02/05/time-to-stop-aid-for-africa/).

Free market economics seem very cold and uncaring on the surface, but once you get a bit deeper you can understand that the intention is truly to deliver the most good to the most people over an arbitrarily long period of time.

"
t3_bpxld,reddit.com,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9463731646537781,"Well. I appreciate your reply. I won't say I agree with everything you've said, but you do make your points well. The initial question was ""Why do I fear Islam"" and the front page of today's New York Times had an article on the fact that Somali Islamists have declared that they will kill any radio station employee who plays music. What's with the Taliban and their hatred of the pleasures of life like music and movies? This example alone shows why Islam is to be feared. Life under Sharia is horrid. As I write this, it just so happens that the subject of tonight's South Park episode is that certain characters are demanding Mohammed's face be shown and the characters don't want to do it because they know they will be killed if they do! So the issue of Islamic rules being forced upon our secular society is the essence of the plot!

You make some observations in your reply that I must question. You assert that the Koran does not give permission, if not outright encouragement, for Muslims to kill infidels. I found many passages in the Koran that support this idea, but considering that under Sharia law, anyone who converts from Islam to another religion is condemned to death, I would have to say that your claim that Islam tolerates other religions does not stand up.  

Now it's clear that you are a believer in God and revelations and I am not. God doesn't exist, so all this fighting is over nothing. I'm sure you've noticed that most of those who are credited with having received revelations (Moses, Abraham, Jesus, Mohammed) lived centuries ago. There is a scientist who has a theory that the human mind was not as developed a thousand years ago as it is today and that the right and left halves of the brain were nearly separate entities. In other words, people in the olden days were all essentially schizophrenics who heard voices. It's an unprovable theory, but I consider it very possible. We both know that if someone today said he heard the word of God, he would be sent to a mental ward. If he made this claim in Saudi Arabia, he would have his head cut off. Certainly you must consider that the story told by the creator of the Mormon church, Joseph Smith, is utterly absurd. He claimed that he had golden tablets that he kept hidden in a hat (that he would not let anybody else see). He would put his head into the hat and pretended to read God's words from these imaginary plates. Now obviously, he made up everything as he went along and there were no golden plates from God. You know this and I know this, but the Mormon's have based their faith on this nonsense. But if we both know that Joseph Smith never received any actual revelations from God, then why believe that Mohammed did? Isn't it just as possible that he either heard schizophrenic voices in his head or just made things up as he went along and was just a fraudulent messiah? A successful fraud, but a fraud nonetheless. I mean, why are you so sure that Mohammed was a true prophet? Just because he said he was? In that case, I claim to be the messiah. Do you believe me? If not, why not?

Now you may say that you personally do not mind if I criticize Islam and that makes you fairly progressive. But it is a fact that the harder line Islamics, the one's who would probably consider you an infidel for using the internet for non-jihad puposes, are really in fact trying to make any criticism of Islam into a global crime. This would be unconstitutional in the US, but Europe seems to be caving to this terror backed demand. Again, tonight's episode of South Park is based entirely on the fact that they cannot show Mohammed's face on the show or they will be killed. I have no objection to the idea that no true Muslim should create or show an image of Mohammad's human form, but I deeply resent the threat made to my secular society that we too must obey Islamic law or face murder. 

Now as to the whole 9/11 incident. You state that no Muslim is allowed to commit the murder of innocents and then you quickly move on to support the rather absurd conspiracy theories surrounding the events of that day. I could go on about this for about a hundred pages, but I'll try to hold to the key points. First of all, Muslims kill innocent people every day. Even the most ""let's blame everything on the US and Israel"" Muslim knows that the bombs that go off every day in Baghdad are set off by Muslims from one sect killing Muslims from another sect. We both know it's not the Americans or the Jews who are setting off these bombs in marketplaces. Now I'm not defending the US invasion of Iraq. That was the stupidest decision ever made by our power mad leaders. And I'm not saying that the American elites are not evil enough to have committed the crime of 9/11. And yes, I've seen the conspiracy theorists that try to convince us that there were explosives placed in the buildings and that the 20 Arabs who planned the attack were patsies framed by the CIA and Mossad. The terrible truth is that I wish our government was clever enough to pull off this crime and this frame up job (faking the flight school attendance of the perpetrators, faking the photographs of them boarding the planes, faking their identities, planting bombs in the towers...), but the sad truth is that the US government might be evil enough to do such a crime, but no way could they have pulled it off. Besides, if you want to create an excuse to topple Saddam for daring to sell oil for euros instead of dollars, why frame 20 Saudis? Why not frame 20 Iraqis? And why is it so hard to believe that two fuel filled burning 747's blazing away in the heart of these two buildings couldn't melt enough steel to cause the buildings to pancake? Who needs thermite when you've got thousands of gallons of jet fuel melting the buildings' framework? Face it. 19 Muslims crashed the planes into the buildings and tried to kill ten to thirty thousand people. Muslims do in fact kill innocent people all the time. Every day.

Again, I do not excuse the behavior of America and Britain in the Middle East. I do not excuse the behavior of Israel towards the Palestinians. I understand why there was and is a desire on the part Muslims to kick back at the West. We have committed terrible injustices against Muslims. You would have to be a fool to pretend otherwise. So take the credit for 9/11. I may hate Osama Bin Laden. Given the chance, I'd kill him myself. But one thing he is not is a liar. He took credit for 9/11 and I see no reason to doubt his word. The WTC was targeted for destruction by Muslims long ago and they did not stop till they succeeded.

You speak words in support of Sharia law. While I agree that Western law can be weak, I do not believe that Sharia law represents an improvement. First of all, from my point of view, the fact that a woman's testimony is worth less than a man's testimony is shameful and renders Sharia ""trials"" worthless. Do you, a person who uses the internet and is capable of polite conversation on highly sensitive topics, really believe that mutilating people is a reasonable form of punishment? Do you really believe that the proper punishment for adultery is to have one's brains smashed to bits with stones? What's wrong with divorce and alimony? Most men would rather lose their brains than their money. Why the need for blood? As for woman who cheat, again, what's wrong with divorce without alimony? Do you really think that the institution of marriage would be made stronger if backed by the terror of horrendous and torturous death? This would hold true only if the woman were forced into loveless marriages at the age of 9 as happens in Yemen, where a child bride recently bled to death when her elderly ""husband"" raped her to death. Do you support for such an abomination to be labelled ""marriage""?

And the burqa? It's a living coffin and I will never believe that any sane woman who hasn't been brainwashed from birth to believe she must hide herself would ever choose to wear such a frightening garment. You consider that prostitution and pornography are worse than the burqa. This is a sensitive topic, but I'll be blunt. Most woman like sex. Most woman I know find that Muslim men are disgusted by woman who like sex and are, in fact, terrible lovers who want woman to lay still, get fucked (sorry to be rude) and not show any pleasure or be considered whores. I mean, how can it be otherwise? How can an Arab woman go about her day in a living coffin and then be anything but a corpse in the bedroom coping with a man who couldn't find a clitoris if his life depended on it (and he's not looking for it anyway). I know some prostitutes and they admit that like it or not, they have orgasms if the man knows what he's doing. Personally, I like the idea of women enjoying sex.

You mention that Islam is a fast growing religion. Unfortunately, in the US, Islam spreads mostly in prisons where violent men are taught that they have a god given dominion over woman. No wonder they like it.

You do seem to agree that it's time for the Shias to stop bloodying themselves over an event that occurred centuries ago. On this we agree. My point was that time seems to have stopped in the Islamic world, and this at a time where events outside the Muslim world are accelerating at at rapid pace. This means that the Middle East is doomed to poverty and ignorance at a time when the world is going high tech. Let's be honest. Once the oil runs out, nobody will care if the Muslim world starves to death. Islam killed science in the Middle East. Before Islam the Arab and Persian world produced algebra and astronomy. After Islam....nothing.

I don't know anything about this Bilal character. I'll see who he was and what he did. My point, however, was that time moves fast in the West and we benefit from it, and that time has stopped dead in the Middle East and Muslims are paying a terrible price for the end of all social and scientific progress in the area.

Have a good evening."

And a caveat. You can (and I would) make the arguement that New York is the greatest city in the world. However, too many New Yorkers take that to mean they are the greatest people in the world (they aren't).  This is doubly true of Yankees fans. So while I am arguing that New York's food is second to none, and I previously mentioned a lot of the other great things about a city with New York's critical mass (and I should have added Wealth), I really am just trying to justify my comment on the food. It's every where here and it's delicious. "
t3_br46a,Seattle,2,0,3,NEGATIVE,0.9842028617858887,"&gt;What's public transportation like? 

[Get an orca card](http://www.orcacard.com/ERG-Seattle/p1_001.do) - many, or most of Sound Transit buses have WIFI.  Buses are pretty reliable.  Also, most buses have bike-racks in the front, so you can bike to your bus stop, toss the bike on the rack, ride to downtown then bike to your destination.  Works fairly well for me.

&gt;Is it a reasonable way to get around town or are people more dependent on cars? 

When we moved here 4 years ago we were able to get rid of one car and drive the remainder once/twice a week.  The savings in gas &amp; wear &amp; tear make up for the hassle of waiting for a bus.

&gt;How bad is the no sunlight, really? Do you feel more depressed than living in other places?

Some winters (2008) seemed darker / longer than the last one - we had a few nice weeks this winter that made coping with the long stretches easier.  Some people purchase a light, some people go on vacation.  If you think you're sensitive to Seasonal Affective Disorder go over it w/ your doc.  Most adapt and cope fine from my experience.

&gt;Is it super expensive to live in the city and/or a bad idea? I lived in another capital for a while and an hour commute into town wasn't worth it, but city living wasn't that expensive either.

Depends on neighborhood &amp; accommodation;  if you're looking for a really secure multi-room unit downtown that accepts pets - yea, $$$;  if you're willing to live a bit away, you can find values.  Having a dog seems to reduce the # of possibilities significantly.  


&gt;Is Seattle a friendly city? How easy is it to meet people compared to other cities?

t3_br1dq,science,20,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9984488487243652,"There was a recent NYtimes article on a similar program with elementary school kids in urban New York; their standardized test score improvements were unprecedented.  Giving teachers, and parents, very small payoffs (small in comparison to the tens of thousands spent averaged per student on education) had an even more dramatic effect.  

They only had funding for elementary school.  Detractors got hung up on the fact that those students in the program only did slightly better than average in high school.  However, this seems only an argument to continue the practice through high school.  

Fuck the love of learning and the joy of numbers schlock about education: that's something you get only after you've got it.  Life in poor neighborhoods is hand-to-mouth.  And a little bit of extra earning power is a lot of extra social status in those neighborhoods.  If the system remains unchanged, the only way you can achieve that extra earning power is to wait decades for the completion of your college education, at which point you will be alienated and geographically removed from your current social group, and will likely be a second class citizen in your more economically mobile social group.  In contrast, earning sub-minimum wage running drugs as a minor can give you enough cash for a new pair of shoes within a week.  

Inner city drug dealers understand how to motivate kids to work hard and make huge sacrifices for modest, short-term gains.  Academics with sticks up their asses pretend that this world is an ideal one; and that love of learning motivates against all odds and social pressures that proclaim it a dead end.  Half of male students will end up incarcerated, and we insist on doing nothing to change the educational system when most kids are raised in broken, uneducated, homes.  

This is the real fucking world.  Educated parents understand how it works, and withhold allowance and privileges as a result of substandard grades.  I'm a PhD candidate in the sciences now, and my parents withheld the carrot when I didn't get straight A's as a child.  College students know this, because their scholarships and loans are dependent on their academic performance.  If I see a kid wearing AF in a class I TA, and I see another kid in Walmart clothes, I know which one will outperform.  One is well aware of the cost associated with education, and the other is dumbly oblivious.  

Let's stop fucking around with our ideas about how the world should be.  Instead, we should take a pragmatic approach, and go with what works in controlled studies. "
t3_br33r,travel,9,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9651280045509338,"Okay, here goes.

**12-15 day trip:** stick to your first three must visit destination and save the rest for later. You don't want to hit too much on your first go, and after your first trip, should you be bitten by the wanderlust that has bitten many of us, you'll be better prepared and can enjoy Europe even more on your second, third, etc. visit.

**16-18 day trip: add Prague.** Why Prague? It is beautiful, it's next to Austria, and also because it will be different and provide a contrast to your 3 other destinations.

**Give yourself at least 4 days in each country** because trust me, you'll need it. I know that as a first timer your inclination is to be a power-tourist and just be on the go all the time. And honestly, there's nothing wrong doing the whole power tourist thing, and I should know since many of my travels are just an extra few days tacked-on at the end of my work trips. That said, if you do want to rushrushrush, I'd alternate it so that you rushrushrush and then take it slow and then rushrushrush. 

**Forget packaged trips.** Buy your own tickets, book your own hotels, and run it yourself. One resource I'd recommend is the [FlyerTalk forum](http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/) -- it's originally a forum for frequent flyers and us obsessive airline miles nerds but it has got boatloads of travel forums and they're good. It also has forums for bargains and all so do look around. (Guided tours to sights, however, can be worth it. I wasn't sure if you're thinking of guided visits to locations or a packaged tour.)

**You ask ""What to do?""** Now, this can get quite overwhelming. My first time ""travelling"" was a work trip. I got sent to Paris with just a few hours notice. Before this trip, I had no clue how to prepare. I bought Lonely Planet guidebooks, read them, found them too thick to go through and wondering wtf I'll miss if I don't read them ... etc. 

That said, **DO buy a guidebook**, but know that you don't have to read the whole thing. My personal preference is a combination of Lonely Planets and Rough Guide. I can't live with just one for one city. I prefer LP's quick guides for a city/country and combine it with RG's full-blown guides. Once you get them, look at their top 20-30 must do list at the beginning of the book to generate some ideas. 

You can also do basic google searches like ""3 days in norway"" and see what you come up with. Another thing to do is target your interests. Let's say Norway: you want to see architecture and scenery. Start googling for things architecture related to see in the country, start checking out for scenic drives, and so on.

That's just the tip of the iceberg. Google and google maps is your friend. Likewise with the Lonely Planet and Rough Guide websites. 

**Oh, one last thing: don't try and pack your whole house.** You'll want comfort, I know, but pack for a week + some extras and do your laundry at laundromats. Don't be afraid to do this--I know this was one of the things that set me back early in my travels. As the years went by, I learned to bring less and less with me as I realize that as different as things can be, they also aren't all that different.

Hope that helps!

t3_br33r,travel,2,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9970585107803345,"A) Don't try to see everything on too hectic a schedule - all you'll end up seeing will be train stations and hotel rooms. Consider that the day you arrive and the day you leave a place really aren't days when you can relax and enjoy yourself. Better to see a smaller number of places and experience them in calm and comfort, than to rush around and get no more out of it than you would from watching the Travel Channel.

B) A mix of trains and planes is usually best. For shorter journeys, up to 5 or 6 hours, the train works well. Longer than that and it can make more sense to fly.

C) St. Petersburg: Remember that you need to get a visa in advance to go to Russia. This can be arranged through your hotel or through specialised agencies. You could get there by ferry from Helsinki but otherwise this is probably a place to fly to. The city is - in parts - staggeringly beautiful. There are cultural treasures beyond measure. It's a hassle to add to the rest of your trip, though.

D) Prague: It's beautiful but I definitely wouldn't say the top place in Europe to visit. Somewhere like Sevilla or Barcelona in Spain gives you more in terms of architectural beauty, edible food, friendly people, nightlife, music, culture. I've been to Prague once, and I enjoyed it, but I have no particular urge to return. Spain, annoying as it can be, still seems to pull me back every few years.

E) Zurich: Meh. Only if it's on the way somewhere.

F) Amsterdam: I'm biased but I wouldn't pass it up. A very beautiful city, much more affordable than most of the other places you have in mind, very accessible and friendly, and sure to be on your route anyway given your likely destinations. In the springtime when everyone hits the streets and shakes off this year's particularly long and miserable winter, it's an absolute delight."

t3_bra9m,gaming,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.8915858864784241,"&gt; In real life, that city would be an absolute nightmare - at least for me. Being crammed together, every ounce of possible space being used, nothing growing because you've got another skyscraper where a park could be...bah.

It works and it doesn't.  Keep in mind the architectural principle of [setbacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setback_(architecture))-- constructing successive levels of buildings to a narrower profile than the level below it.  One critical success of this design is that it allows air and sunlight to penetrate (and air to circulate) much more effectively than the cramped, stuff everything possible into available space, neo-baroque designs that blighted much of Europe throughout industrialization (and even before...see Paris under Hausmann).

The idea of setbacks applies not only to the architectural structure of the building, but also to its physical setting within the environment.  One of the great urban applications of this modernist idea is setting buildings back from the edge of the lot line, allowing it to be surrounded by green space (or, in the case of American cities, roads with perhaps a small lawn or plaza).

When these two ideas were combined in New York City, the result was the [Superblocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_block#Superblock)-- massive high-rise residential buildings set into large, park-like spaces, connected not by roads but by walkways and sidewalks.  This style has been copied and propagated throughout the world, with mixed results (keep in mind that by definition, any city planning or urban design project is necessarily imperfect).

TL;DR: This idea (all buildings and no roads) works reasonably well because removing space from automobiles allows you to set large-scale developments into park-like settings, preserving green space and providing utility."

Though I think the establishment of a claim is problematic, I don't think that someone having a small homestead (namely within the Lockean Proviso) causes a problem. What I see as land-related problems are when someone has an empty lot in New York City that they aren't using but won't let go of and it increases urban sprawl and greenfield development. Or, in the case of someone like Ted Turner who owns thousands of acres more or less at the expense of others.

Most usable land is legally occupied whether it's in use or not (and even if it is, it could be being used really inefficiently). This leads to people crying for a need for a job (since they can't legally homestead in most places anymore). This also leads to people crying out for wealth redistribution. Rather than looking at things as earned through voluntary trade or self-exertion versus unearned through force, theft, and monopoly privileges, many now see things as rich versus poor. This cheapens trade and effort by lumping it in with theft and privilege.

Replace land with economic land to include stuff like fisheries, EM spectrum, minerals, etc. and the problems are similar.

I think David Ricardo was onto something when formulated the law of rent. Henry George basically ran with it and showed that when rent arises it's because of theft of opportunity."

Although it can be a lot more fun. :-) I assume that you know that there a lot of people from the US reading these posts. I take you literally when you said: ""If you still don't get it, think of it this way: there's a giant country that is far richer than *your* country... [emphasis added]""

Next point: ""Do rural villages and poor places places have YMCAs or index funds..."" I have posted elsewhere here refuting the proposition that Chinese factories are in rural areas. Rural areas do not have the infrastructure to support the kind of outsourced manufacturing, or sweatshops as they are known in this thread, that multinational like Microsoft, Dell and Logitech need. They are located in the city areas. And trust me, there are a ton of them in China. I came across the research I can assure you that they have dozens of cities about the size of New York, Chicago, LA etc. The Chinese workers who were video- interviewed in an extensive New York Times article about the world downturn in the economy on their situation complained about missing their parents and friends in the villages because they were required to move to cities and from city to city to obtain the high-paying jobs provided by *both* Chinese and American affiliated employers. Moreover, China is not the subservient colony willing to sacrifice its people for the profits of foreign corporations that some people seem to believe. I am guessing here, but given the nascent nationalism demonstrated by the Olympics, ordinary Chinese people would not put up with sweatshops. In any event, as I posted elsewhere, I don't believe that the OP here as demonstrated their existence by still photographs and an advocacy organization's ""report"" .

Basically, I have a fundamental disagreement with you regarding the delicacy of the economy, whether that makes any fucking difference whatsoever to the Chinese government who will move 1 million people with the stroke of a pen, and this romanticizing of farm life. Peasant farming is backbreaking, unfulfilling, a pox on the human condition, and can and should be done away with wherever possible. Yes, regulate big factory farms, but don't bring back subsistence farming. There's a movement in this country for people to pay more money for food to get local food, food grown without pesticides, you know the drill. However that only works in countries that are rich. In poor countries, people just want food because they're hungry. China is rapidly transforming from an agrarian country to an urban country. California still working on getting environmental reports together to build a single high-speed train from San Francisco/Sacramento to Los Angeles. China has already built one and has just announced plans to build I forget how many thousands of miles of these trains to connect some of their major cities. I have far greater faith in the Chinese their ambitious plans before California finishes the first stage of its plan -- Anaheim to downtown LA. LOL

Finally, dude look around. The 21st century belongs to China. That's the way it's heading. They have the will, the resources, increasing vast reserves of hard foreign-currency, the ability to undertake construction projects that are often the largest in the world. I have seen the Three Gorges dam in person. Their semi-authoritarian government allows them to move decisively. Almost always at the expense of many individuals. But I think whether these sweeping decisions are reached democratically or autocraticly, people are going to suffer. I guess you call it the price of progress. 

Finally, I believe that we *cannot* impose our own norms, mores, values, and ethical judgments on the Chinese people. They have thousands of years of history. They are going to do things the Chinese way. All are huffing and puffing about ""sweatshops"" won't make a whit of difference. I totally believe that sweatshops exist in some countries and that we can do something about it by boycotting the goods. I don't believe the same kind of analysis and conclusions can be blindly applied to the special case of China. As it stands now this seems to be aspects of Chinese society that are both optimistic and pessimistic. I believe that it is entirely possible that in 50 years China will have an equivalent or better standing of living than the US without many of its drawbacks. I also believe the same thing could happen but with those drawbacks exaggerated. Only time will tell.

Exageration #1. In 3rd world countries, there is little to no education available to anyone. That people graduate high school at a high rate is an astounding feat.

&gt;* Debt wise.

Exageration #2. This is probably the closest. Our debt is bad and getting worse, but we still produce *a lot* of stuff, as well as services. Even if our debt:production ratio were as bad as a typical 3rd world country, being in debt does not make a country 3rd world. 

&gt;* Even in third world countries, the people who have solid jobs have access to relatively good healthcare. 

Exageration #3. This one's not even close. While basic medical services might be available to some extent, complex surgeries, etc. are usuallu few and far between. The main problem with 'health care' in 3rd world countries stems from access to clean water.

&gt;* Relative poor public transportation.

Exageration #4. Did Ethiopia install the equivalent to the NYC Subway while I wasn't looking? Certainly we have less than many European countries, but we are also far more spread out/less densely populated (suburban sprawl). We rely on cars much more, but it doesn't make us 3rd world.

Overall, I think where we disagree is in our definitions of what constitutes a 3rd world country. We need to agree upon a definition first before we can decide how much the US falls into that category. Certainly we have problems, but we're still the #1 economy in the world with a high degree of economic freedoms.

Now, ""manning the stone"" is really a stupid job, since there is nothing that I or anyone can do to have any effect on this thing. It's inertia, as I soon learned, was far larger than any force I could apply. 

On sweaty hot day a fire alarm went off down the street. Looking toward the sound I saw a sign on the street advertising Ice Cream sodas. From the other direction came the Doppler effected sound of the city's finest coming to check the alarm. For those who don't know, most streets in NYC are pretty hollow. You can feel the rumble of a subway train below you or, in this case, a truck on the street. This rumble shook my feet only a fraction of a second before it shook the dolly, and then the stone. A tremble, then a shaking, then, in an instant, a pitch; the rock fell to the street in an instant as if I wasn't even there in its path. 

No pain yet. A flash of yelling and commotion as all those nearby rushed to lift the thing from my hips and legs where it rested. Sure that I was paralyzed, it was a relief to be pulled free and feel with certainty that my right ankle was thoroughly broken. However it wasn't until a moment later attempting to stand that I saw my right hand. 

The work glove, now sticky with blood, was torn at the end of the middle finger and showed on it's palm through this hole a misplaced fingernail. The last knuckle of the finger was all but torn off and spun to face me. 

It wasn't until later that I was able to piece together that it was not the stone but the hoist that had torn off this nub. The stone had forced me to the ground to fast that my hand had whipped against the edge of the hoist and pulverized the bit that made contact.

Now this still isn't the pain yet, sorry. I was still in shock. In the hospital, some pain, but muted by meds. In surgery, no pain, only vibrations of bone being cut down. Even going home no real pain. It was only late at night, the first night home, in a deep sleep that I was awakened by pain. It was unlike anything I have ever experienced. I couldn't make a sound, or even crawl. Even in the pitch black I would've sworn my hand was on fire. It was immobilizing. Finally I was able to fall out of bed toward my end table and reach the pain medicine. I crushed the pills in my mouth to quicken the effect and after what seemed like an hour on the floor was finally able to regain my bearings and get back into bed. 

And that's it. One time. For only a few minutes I'm sure. You can bet I never forgot to take my pills after that. This was 12 years ago and it still is the most intense physical pain I have ever felt. 

tl:dr Big rock fell on me, knocked off my finger, pain meds wore off."

I swear to God, I actually had this dream about 10 years ago.

I'm in a mall, and I'm hungry. I decide to go to Subway inside the mall, but there is a really long line. Fortunately, there is another Subway in the mall directly across from the first one.

I go over there, and there are a bunch of chicks dressed in pink biker jackets (like in Grease). They all give me nasty, mean looks so I get out of there.

All of the sudden, I'm walking down the hall of my old junior high school. I see a doctor down the hall. He is played by Kevin Spacey.

I decide I would like to ask him what my previous dream means (pink biker subway girls). When he sees me, he turns and starts running for his life. He runs into a supply closet and I go in after him. He begs me not to kill him. I say I just want him to interpret my dream and he's like ""Oh, that's all?""

I explain the pink biker Subway girls to him. He thinks for second, then he says, ""Sorry, I think it means you're gay.""

I'm like, ""Oh no! Really?"" Then he says, ""Ha! No! That's just what I tell everybody!""

So I'm back in the school hallway. This time I'm in a canoe with wheels, and I'm pushing myself along using a baseball bat as a paddle. I get up and walk out the door into the courtyard, and the entire student body is there. They appear to have been waiting for me.

For some reason, I'm supposed to fighting a little person (dwarf). He seems very upset with me.

As the crowd draws in around us to watch, I see Adam Sandler on the sideline. He tells his friends he has with him, ""Oh yeah! The only thing that could make this better is a little Boston solo!""

He then proceeds to air guitar the solo to More Than a Feeling.

Then I woke up."

Look, I love FPS games.  In fact, they're my favorite genre of games, but the Fallout, Commandos and C&amp;C series were still dear to my heart.  When I heard Bethesda had acquired the Fallout 3 license, I was actually hoping they'd take the game into first-person view!  I've always been of the opinion that FPS was the direction Fallout should've taken in the first place, because essentially the game is about being a loner.  When you make a game about controlling one character but make it a turn-based, clicking strategy game, things get pretty boring fast.  I even pre-ordered Fallout 3 in my enthusiasm.

Fallout 3 sucked.  The only thing it kept from the old series was some vestiges of lore.  Every character in it was instantly forgettable, the interactions between you and the world was pitiful and they took the ""wasteland"" idea too far.  If I wanted a game about desolation I would play Stalker.  Fallout traditionally has **tons** of characters and thriving, vibrant communities.  Obviously you can't have anything teeming like Tokyo or New York, but there was still Vault City, Reno, Klamath and Shady Hills.  There were inner plotlines to those cities.  What involving quest chain is there in Fallout 3?  All I can think of is the missing Android.  In the past two Fallouts, off the top of my head I can name the two factions of the Shi in San Francisco, the crime families of New Reno and the friction between the Hubologists and the Brotherhood of Steel.  You stayed in these towns and really got to know them and the people, and they stuck in your mind because you had a real effect on events.

This isn't the case in Fallout 3.  Everyone lives sparse communities that feel like they were added in as an afterthought.  Most of the game doesn't revolve around questing, but instead trudging through the same identical subway station you've been fighting in for the past five years, going from point to point to point.  And worse, the combat wasn't even entertaining.  All the Perks you receive as buffs.  This doesn't work in an FPS-style game.  Perks you receive should be **active** skills that give you new abilities, not just upgrades that let you carry more stuff or get more crits.  This means that every single playthrough you do will be identical.

Deus Ex and the System Shocks are examples of FPS-RPGs done right.  DX gives you tons of character interaction, a great swath of different active/passive skill development and no useless gameplay segments to artificially increase boredom.  There is not a single point in Deus Ex where you aren't working for someone or towards something.  You never have to grind through a dozen subway stations full of mindless zombies and raiders (Another thing about FO3 -- boring AI, which they justified in lore by making your enemies dumb as dirt because its their nature.  Just because it makes sense doesn't mean it makes it fun.) to progress from one point in the storyline to another.  The Fallout series didn't make you do this, either.  There was the wasteland for when you wanted random fun and there were the towns for when you wanted direction.  The System Shocks took complex FPS-RPG gameplay and made it applicable to a setting where you are the lone wolf.  FO3 could've learned a lot from either of these examples, but they didn't.

**tl;dr**  Loved the FPS change for Fallout 3, but thought overall it was terrible because of awful game design.  Also why I'm so excited about New Vegas -- smart guys known for awesome quest design making the FPS Fallout game I always wanted.  Therefore, I am being very pessimistic about X-Com.  Would love to see a great FPS-RPG X-Com with base building, UFO downing and upgrading, but I don't think for a second they could actually pull this off.  The market doesn't want complex FPS-RPGs.  It already proved that with the huge success of the Bioshocks and Fallout 3.  My dream is the new Syndicate game will retain the R&amp;D, corporate sabotage, taxing and research elements of the originals while having highly developed squad-based gameplay (where the different weapons/items you research actually create different experiences, like a stealth-based squad using cloakers and sniper rifles or a tanked out squad).  That is also an Empty Dream in this age."

really....

http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/35785.html

&gt; Just days after the first widespread tea party demonstrators hit the streets a year ago Thursday, Joe Wierzbicki, a Republican political consultant with the Sacramento firm Russo Marsh + Rogers, made a proposal to his colleagues that he said could “give a boost to our PAC and position us as a growing force/leading force as the 2010 elections come into focus.”
&gt;
&gt; The proposal, obtained by POLITICO, was for a nationwide tea party bus tour, to be called the Tea Party Express, which over the past seven months has become among the most identifiable brands of the tea party movement. Buses emblazoned with the Tea Party Express logo have brought speakers and entertainers to rallies in dozens of small towns and big cities, including one in Boston on Wednesday that will feature former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin.
&gt;
&gt; Aided by campaign-style advance work and event planning, slick ads cut by Russo Marsh, impressive crowds and a savvy media operation, the political action committee run by Wierzbicki, Russo Marsh founder Sal Russo and a handful of other Republican operatives has also emerged as among the prolific fundraising vehicles under the tea party banner. Known as Our Country Deserves Better when it was founded during the 2008 election as a vehicle to oppose Barack Obama’s campaign for president, the PAC saw its fundraising more than quadruple after it took the Tea Party Express public in July, raising nearly $2.7 million in roughly the following six months, compared with less than $600,000 in the preceding six months, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html

&gt; The 18 percent of Americans who identify themselves as Tea Party supporters tend to be Republican, white, male, married and older than 45.

Although they did receive a headline on the NY Post sports cover today - for their loss against the Flyers.

The Rangers are still top dog in the town, but considering how close the Prudential Center is to NYC (a 15 minute train ride from downtown - about the same amount of time it takes to get to the Garden/midtown from downtown NY).

The biggest problem with the Devils is the fact that New Jersey is in their name. And the fact that Lamoriello wouldn't let his players market themselves. That's changed since he was demoted from Team President. I guess demoted is a harsh word - but he is only team GM now, and is no longer in charge of business operations. Marty Brodeur was offered to be on David Letterman a bunch of times (I think recently and I remember after the Cup win in 2003) but he hasn't appeared. I don't know if the team stopped him or what, but this was a bad decision by the Devs.

What's also interesting to note is that the Rangers receive higher ratings than the NY Knicks (and the Rags have had higher attendance over the past 5 years). 

But actually, to refute all of the points I brought up - hockey does do decently in the New York market. It is spoken about on late night news and the Rangers definitely have a strong presence in the area. And actually the NJ Devils are usually on the front page of some of the local papers when they do well. The teams do have a grasp on the casual sports fans here.

 * Try and reduce the commute from home to work/friends. It sounds obvious but in London public transport is ridiculously unreliable. It is common for tubes to be cancelled and buses to simply not arrive. Nothing ruins the whole London experience more than waiting in the cold rain. And trust me that nice penthouse will quickly go to waste if your losing over 1-2 hours a day in commuting (very common). 

 * Similar to this is finding somewhere close to night buses as the last midnight tube will drive you insane. 

 * If you have any flexibility with working hours then try to arrive and leave early. 

 * Get out of the city as much as possible. It's so easy to never leave because on the weekends you inevitably are either going to events, catching up with friends you never see or relaxing. But Paris, Berlin etc are so close that it is crazy not to do it more often.

 * Join a gym. You will likely spend a lot of time after work going out for drinks or catching up with people. And nobody does pubs like London does :) So make sure to exercise to counteract all the drinking.

 * Understand and appreciate the English. They aren't direct like many other cultures and prefer to discuss issues rather than action them. But they make up for it with extraordinary creativity. So definitely checkout all the great events going on, visit Lazarides Gallery and know your urban artists e.g. Banksy, DFace.

 * Explore the boroughs. Each area is completely different and it's very easy to stick to the same ones.

Out of all the Premier League teams out there I'd have to say that Man Utd are my favourite for two reasons. I first had the opportunity to watch them when I was very young, back when they weren't winning everything but had won a League Cup trophy, and I preferred the football that they played over the other teams I had contact with, Leeds United and Liverpool. One time when I had the chance to see Man Utd train I got a football signed by fifteen players. Sadly, instead of keeping it in case it'd be worth a lot of money I decided to play football with it as much as possible, and it broke pretty quickly. My Dad is a Liverpool fan, so choosing Man Utd as my favourite Premier League team was pretty easy.

Despite this, the team that truly has my support is Bristol City. Before I was born they were completely ruined financially and through dumb luck they had managed to keep the side as a name alive through a new holding company in 1982. They had to tear up the contracts of their players, and obviously successive relegations followed. My family like rivalry, and as Bristol City were on the way to rebuilding themselves as a football side with Bristol Rovers being the stronger team, and my Dad's favourite team Bristol City was a natural choice for me. Over time they've developed into a good footballing side and although they've sacked the best manager they've had in years because the fans couldn't handle not handle another freak promotion battle I still support them through and through.

t3_brmdy,reddit.com,17,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9887838959693909,"Ahh, a now old chestnut of a video clip. What the comparison misses, along with most people who argue about such things is, the combat/design philosophy that influenced each weapon. It pretty much makes them an apple/oranges comparison.
 
During WW2, Kalashnikov began his design and proto-type testing in 1944. So he was heavily influenced by tactics of the time. Which meant close quarters. And Russian tactics of the time was pretty much close to hand to hand ranges and fight the enemy. The grenade, submachine gun, and the bayonet were important weapons.

All sides did combat studies that demonstrated that most small-arms combat doesn't even start to take place until ranges are under 300 meters. And that soldiers are reluctant to fire at targets they don't think they can hit. So rifles that can put 30 rounds into a group you can cover with a dime at 500 meters are perhaps less important than  rifles that can deliver man-sized accuracy at much more modest ranges, 0m to 200m, with complete reliability. This is what Kalashnikov designed for and achieved.

Eugene Stoner designed from the classic US tactical philosophy of standoff combat. We don't like to close with the enemy much. Due to the high casualty rates that tend to go with close in fighting. And the cultural belief that we are a nation of marksmen. So we value that 30 shot dime-sized group at 500 meters. And we design, build, and train  for it.

Another design criteria that gets totally missed is ease and cost of manufacture. Kalashnikov designed his weapon to be easy and fast to make. Wood and steel are cheap compared to aircraft grade materials like plastics and aluminum. The Soviets learned the hard way that weapons often need to be made at breakneck speeds on tooling that is past being worn out by workers with minimal training. Loose tolerances help make that possible. US designers and manufacture's have never had to work under those constraints. The M16/M4 requires more expensive materials made on better tooling by better trained workers to tighter tolerances.

So to me, neither weapon is ""better"". Each weapon fulfills it's design criteria superbly."

Mounts are non-essential means for transportation with versions availible in game that won't cost you a dime. You really don't have to buy it and it won't fragment the player base if you don't.

DLC Maps, while again don't *have* to be purchased, will separate you from those that do (in Halo 3's case) or (in MW2's case) will actually remove playlists to make room for DLC playlists.

It has absolutely no weight unless you accept the Austrian school of economics, that basing a legal system on an economic model is a good idea and that this was the legal system in place in 1900.

The other quote is also pretty random, it's saying that child labour laws are useless, because only about 1% of all children were horribly abused.  The guy also isn't a recognizable expert and it's more of an opinion then a review of conditions of child labour.

&gt;Americans may have been ""poor"" (I don't accept that claim) farmers, but they weren't slaves. They weren't working ~four months out of the year to pay for government waste.

Americans were slaves until the 1860s and even then conditions didn't change much for 50-100 years.  The farmers weren't too bad off, but a bad crop could hand everything over to banks and the factory and rail workers were experiencing dangerous work conditions for below living wages.

&gt;People die from cold and hunger in 2010. Women and African American voting rights has nothing to do with taxation. There is much more pollution in 2010 than in 1900. There is just as much squalor, misery, and brutality as well. None of that has to do with taxation, though. In fact, not much of anything you laid out has anything to do with taxation.

Crime is at an all time low, cities are clean, we don't have London fogs from burning coal.  The cities aren't filled with cholera and typhoid.  The racial ghettos are getting smaller (compared to 1900) and there is more mobility in the nation.  The reason is public health initiatives, Medicare, pollution standards, public education, policing and infrastructure.  

&gt;None of the laws you've mentioned or changes over the past 100 years should increase your tax burden by 20+ percent.

But the sum total makes it reasonable.  That is assuming you support the 50% that goes towards having one of the largest standing army in active deployment around the world.

You need to start looking at real history.  For all the current flaws (and there are tonnes of them) the time and place you live (US right?) is easily one of the best.  If you were given the choice would you rather live in 1900 with a 6% tax burden or right now with a 35% tax burden?"

The new public transport system works brilliantly - the buses move huge numbers of people around cheaply and quickly, and it's largely because of *excellent* political maneuvering by the government. Every report of the Gautrain says that it kicks ass, and will be a great way to get to and from the airport, and between various city centres.

I drive around Joburg plenty, and the roads are mostly very usable. Where they aren't, it's usually because of construction being undertaken for the World Cup.

As for the crime - sure, it's a problem. But it's not anarchy by any standards. I just got back from a night at a bar in a very average area. Had a great time. Drove back fine, without ever feeling nervous. Never hesitate to drive into Newtown, the CBD, or Braamfontein - some of the ""bad"" areas. And I've never had an issue. Hillbrow's got an appalling reputation, but you won't be able to move for police there in June/July.

Definitely, definitely don't take advice from people who haven't been here in a few years. A lot has changed. There are many, many more police around - particularly in places like the airport, where crime was a problem. The city centre has been transformed entirely - the Joburg Development Agency has taken entire derelict areas and turned them around 180 degrees.

It's worth mentioning that the prevailing concern on Radio 702 - which is an independent station that does a good job at nailing the government to the wall when they need to - is that there won't be enough new trees and flowers planted in time for the World Cup. Joburg's dry in winter, and there might not be much foliage. Still, the city is the largest man-made forest in the world. We do alright for greenery.

There are plenty of problems here, but not nearly as many as people seem to be making out. Sure, Cape Town is nicer. Cape Town is a bloody paradise. Best tourist city in the world for a few years running. So that's not a fair comparison. Joburg has its charms too.

The World Cup has a good chance of kicking ass. FIFA thinks so too - they've had a plan B ready from the start, and do you think they'd hesitate to pull the plug if they didn't have faith? They've got too much at stake.

I'm also going to throw in the fact that we've hosted a series of fantastically successful large-scale sporting events in the last year. Including the IPL at a fortnight's notice. Credit where credit's due, please. Sure, none of them was as big as the World Cup'll be. But *nothing's* as big as the World Cup.

Most importantly, please don't talk about South Africans as if we're bumpkins, or children who don't understand the issues or what's at stake. We get it. But we've had a plan, and we've seen it being executed first-hand.

You say a firearm is a ""tool"". Fair enough.

Then you compare it to other ""tools"" that could cause harm....this is where you veer off from reason.

This is a ridiculous comparison...it doesn't make any logical sense....well it does...but it doesn't make sense to bring up because it's irrelevant.

Basically what you are saying is:

""Guns start with the letter G"".

""Gorrillas also start with G, and they're not so bad"".

There's a kernel of a point in what you're saying but it's mostly moot.

Guns are tools yes....but tools DESIGNED to maim and kill. That's their entire function.

A cars is a useful transportation device and nowhere near as dangerous as a gun. To bring up the fact that in theory it could hurt someone or be used as a weapon, misses the point entirely.

The ""sport"" aspect of guns could easily be modified to use less lethal ""tools"", so that's out the window unless the lethality of guns is somehow fundamental to the sport and ""hobby"" of guns (for many I suspect it is).

In terms of self-defense, it's arguable how effective guns are. Yes, there are certain situations where one would probably want a gun....but I don't think it's clear cut if you're more likely to be in one of those than one where it is either unnecessary or even a liability. My judgement is still out on that one.

I would agree that there are many people out there who can ""responsibly"" own guns and not cause problems...I'm just saying lets call a spade a spade and not waffle about with ""well technically a hammer could kill someone""."

I was useless, failing out of community college because I was working 58 hours a week on top of my schedule.  I had started in using illicit substances and drinking.  I tried to kill myself with cold pills.  
  
All the pills managed to do is give me an awful 'trip' where I hallucinated the first day, and felt as though I could only comprehend two dimensions the second.  The third day, however, still feeling the effects of the pills (and still desperately optimistic that they still might kill me) I ended up in Downtown Seattle (lived in Shoreline at the time) at midnight, surrounded by the homeless.  
  
While waiting for the next bus back, I started talking with some of the old homeless people here, giving away a carton of cigarettes in the process.  They acted like somebody had never shown them that kind of generosity.  In exchange, I told them my woes and problems.  By the end of my story, I felt like a jackass, here surrounded by all these people, realizing that their life was far worse than mine.  I stayed down there until the last running of 358, just talking about where they came from.  One guy in a wheelchair had come to Seattle in the '80s with a band, whereupon they had kicked him out.  Another guy had similar interests as me, and we talked at length about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (the ancient novel, of course).  
  
On the bus ride back, I had a new look on life.  No matter how awful your life appears, you could always be homeless.  And homelessness fucking sucks.  
  
So tl;dr, go out there, have your epiphany.  Find out what it is that spurs you on to greatness.  And then?  Follow it.  Mayhaps life doesn't seem to matter in it's inexorable path from beginning to end, but while you're living it, it's the most important thing in the world."
t3_bs0ib,Libertarian,1,0,2,NEGATIVE,0.989915132522583,"libertarianism is, like socialism or communism, an ideal. And on paper, I think it's magnificent. I wholly agree that *free* societies sound and smell better. But, like any ideal, realities are often different. If you push the ideal far enough, of course there are cases that don't work. 

Below someone was talking about buying the land encircling someone, and charging a fee for them to cross. How is this precluded in a *free* society? Do we need a law now that you can't buy the land encircling someone? What if I buy the rivers in New York. I now own the land encircling New York City. Oh boy. Ok, maybe that's extortionate, and we'll pass a law to stop it. How about I buy all the land except for a 10 foot strip? and claim, ""Use that ten foot strip if it bothers you!"" Of course the rest of the land is the land encircling Las Vegas and now people have to travel miles to get to that 10 foot strip, otherwise pay me $5 for crossing, even by foot! Am I not *free* to do that? Are you proposing to limit my liberty by not allowing such nonsense? How dare you point your gun at me! I am a free market entrepreneur! I am innovating! Ahhhh, of course, someone can build a bridge over my land, or dig a tunnel. Ok.. fine, but until they do, I'm a rich man. So, how do we stop this? In a *free* society we can't stop it by law, that would be innovation-crushing regulation.

Truth is, even in a *free* society, there are still ways to screw your neighbor. You might even say you are *free* to do so. In fact, you are *incentivized* to do so, if it leads to profit. And the road system is one place where we see this happen, for the basic reason that the surface of the Earth, where transportation is fundamentally more efficient and practical, is two dimensional and limited. And in the *free* market, nothing would preclude a company from owning *all* the surface transportation veins in a several mile radius. Their only competition then is air transport, elevated highways, and subways. All of these fundamentally more expensive than surface travel. And since roads, being just re-manufactured land, do not need to be paid, watered, or up-kept, such a company would be able to -- in the worst case -- just let their roads rot away until all the people in that several mile radius have... left. But I guess they're free to leave (once they pay the tolls to the road company for their moving trucks) so that's okay.

This could happen. Probably not this badly, it's just a worst case scenario example. But the point is that nothing really incentivizes companies to provide good roads. People need to travel. Travel by car or foot or train has it's fundamental costs, which is the price we pay now, plus some overhead to the government. But if a company owns those roads, maybe even just a large line of them dividing a city, they do not have to charge these costs. They are *free* to charge what they feel, because they know the roads are *valued* by people potentially much more than they *cost*. But this is okay we assert! You are free to leave if they do that!

Blue Smoke (27th Street between Park and Lexington; take the 6 to 28th Street)

This one is a little bit more or a trip, but TOTALLY worth it... The Bayou in Mount Vernon. You'll have to leave the city, but the food is absolutely outstanding, they make some killer drinks, and it has some of the best atmosphere you can ask for. You have to take Metro North up to the Fleetwood station, which is ~25 minutes from Grand Central, and call ahead to see if they have live music/ a cover charge. The bands there are really hit or miss; I've seen some really awesome, laid back, authentic old school reggae, which goes well with dinner, and some cool zydeco bands... but you also have a chance of running headlong into a group of forty-something CPA's doing their best (read: loud and shitty) classic rock impersonation.Makes it hard to carry a conversation, and just kind of ruins the mood, but it's not that common.

If you ever decide to check that place out, give the BBQ pork po'boy a shot, with the Cajun popcorn shrimp as an appetizer. Make sure you have a Swamp Thang, Hurricane or Flaming Jalapeño Colossus with dinner as well.

Gives us the power to allow them this control by virtue of our votes and the lack of a revolt against them when they assert these 'powers'.   

The reason the 10th amendment is ignored is because the Constitution became outdated and the proper procedures to update it (with Amendments ratified by the States) was never done.   Sucks now...but oh well, we can choose to revolt or we can choose to try and change it or we can choose to do nothing.   I am in that last group.   The current laws work as well as can be expected for a country our size in this century with the current World environment.  Some things I would change would be repeal of the Patriot Act and Department of Education and outlaw lobbying.   After that, I would decommission as many overseas bases as is feasible.  Everything else I would change would be pretty minor in comparison to those items.

Yes, tax consumables instead of activities, let me explain why.   When used as directed, snack foods and cigarettes are a unhealthy at *any* level.   They are a treat and a luxury and should be treated as such.   Alcohol, not so much...so maybe I am wrong there.   Activities, on the other hand, are at worst, risky, but have health benefits.   Any activity outdoors should be encouraged - including the ones you listed.   I think if everyone in American regularly did any one of the items you listed, we would have **dramatically** lower healthcare costs.   A broken arm that costs taxpayers $26,000 is far, far lower than the $250,000 to pay for heart operation of a couch potato.   The only activity I would suggest to tax would be driving through higher gas tax for urban areas.   This tax would only be applied to metropolitan areas which have public transportation, rural area gas stations would not have this tax.

I see where it can get slippery, but no one is carelessly giving up their freedoms by wanting more taxes...some of us just see it as a fair tradeoff for some benefits.

I discovered that I like solving problems and collecting information. I became a policy analyst in the New Jersey Senate, and now am a photojournalist at a tabloid newspaper that I love. Within the first two months that I was there, I had three shots make the front page.

The day of the [arrest of 44 NJ politicians](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/nyregion/24jersey.html) I got paged to wake up at 5 A.M. and on the day of the [rape of a 7-year-old girl](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/nyregion/04trenton.html) I was up at 6, responding to a fire, and ended up working on that story later in the evening when it first broke-- about twelve to sixteen hours before anyone picked it up. I like to think that I'm good at my job.

I find that posts with stories get more upvotes, so here's one: I once responded to a shooting on Stuyvesant Ave, which, btw, probably one of the worse neighborhoods in Trenton. I pulled up in my car, flashed P.D. my badge, and dodged past the police tape, camera in hand. Once I got up closer to the crime scene, I shot a picture of two people handcuffed sitting on the steps of what I later found out was their house. It turns out the perp had run in, then ran out the back. P.D. searched the house looking for a gun, but couldn't find one.

We later found out that the guy never had a gun. The father of the now-dead guy called 911 saying his son was carrying a gun and was going to shoot people. The father was emotionally disturbed after having his wife die some time ago, and he supposedly blamed his son. 

Here's the story. The picture attached is mine too, but it's one from the day after: http://www.trentonian.com/articles/2009/07/17/news/doc4a5ff8a0116ed970737852.txt

That's just one story on Stuyvesant. I've made contacts on the street because of that shooting, and now I go back to cover their community events. Despite being a shitty neighborhood at night and early evening, there's some pretty tough people living there, that're working pretty hard to make their lives better. 

The community center on that street is... pretty amazing. The site director there is holding the street together with both of his hands. He's been getting kids to do everything from jump rope competitions to going on trips to the beach. Do you have any idea how important it is for kids to leave their neighborhood? Some get picked up by the bus on their block, and then get dropped off. They never leave the 100 square meters that is their neighborhood. A trip to the beach is an introduction to perspective for these kids.

t3_bsozf,politics,9,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.7733983993530273,"You're delusional.

Public services like medical fire and police are not disproportionately used by the poor. Fire and police are agents of the wealthy, and are in essence guard services which protect the status quo and economic paradigm. The police are entirely an agent of the ruling class keeping the poor in line. The benefit of an ordered society is stability creating economic growth for businesses, yet the cost of maintaining order is largely externalized onto the poor and the middle class - because they use it more? They don't use it more, the wealthy use it to imprison the poor — and you're confusing use, with who benefits from the utility. IE not only do the rich benefit from faster response times for medical, fire, and police emergencies, but in all cases they benefit from every other instantiation. IE a rich person benefits every time any burglar is caught, whether or not that burglar attempted a theft from them specifically. 

This is the same with the military, which accounts for half of our federal budget. The military is not ""protecting"" America on a day to day basis, it is protecting the interests of its economy abroad with the nominal populist disguise of spreading democracy, Our economy is owned for all intents and purposes by less than 1% of our population.

To abstract this, if we did not exist in a massively intertwined global economy, people would be able to survive on their own independently. One could find a plot of land, and hunt and gather in the forest, trading with farmers etc.. we do not NEED this vastly complex economy and social structure in order to exist. However, billionaires could not exist in a state of nature or anything at all similar to the levels of wealth they possess today. A billionaire today is far wealthier and more powerful than any king up until probably Napoleon. Therefore, those who benefit from a system without which they cannot exist, have an obligation to pay for its upkeep, rather than duping others into thinking they require it for their job, for security, their famiy etc... and somehow have more to lose; it will be a dangerous day for the wealthy the day the poor realize they have nothing to lose and the rich have everything.

You make the argument that if you use the roads more, you pay more and that's somehow fair. The fact is that for certain uses of commons, there should be no charge, and others should pay more than they are currently paying.

For example, the MTA in New York is suffering financially. But the idea that individuals even have to pay for it is absurd. Cities exist because they make commerce more efficient for corporations and the ownership class, and cities could not exist without roads or rapid mass transit systems. Yes poor people use the MTA more to get to their jobs and to go about their daily lives, but the ones who benefit from this utility are the wealthy, profiting off the existence of the city, off of the ample supply of labor and the infrastructure to get it to where it needs to be. They should carry the cost of the services proportionally to their gains, they do not.

Almost every tax other than income is highly regressive. Sales tax, the discussion of a VAT, capital gains, anything that is externalized onto the individual making less than 75k a year is bullshit.

In a just world, your first 40-75k in income would be untouched, and everything after that highly taxed, with a logarithmic tax scale that is set annually based on creating an appropriate curve on a data aggregate of all earners in a given population base.

Each year the amount of untaxed income would change, and their wouldn't even be brackets — your tax rate would be calculated relative to society and your place in it income wise.

There's necessary income, and disposable income. In essence, any taxation of income someone needs to survive is just wrong; and given what the average incomes in this country are and the number of people and families below the poverty line, we have an obligation to pay heavily out of our disposable income until others basic needs are met.

Even healthcare; a healthy labor class means greater productivity and greater capital gains for the ownership class.

You're wrong on every single level."

Pretty much everybody lives in a market that has their own radio stations. Now, the big cities are kinda out (New York, L. A. because they are dominated by very big Ad Agencies that control creative over the advertiser...those advertisers are usually very large companies because it takes a lot of money to buy radio and TV in those markets...so it is hard to break in because agencies control the advertisers and agencies do not work with newcomers. If you live in mid-sized markets, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Tallahassee, etc., many of the local merchants can afford to advertise on radio or local TV and many of them handle their own advertising. I lived in the Riverside/San Bernardino, CA area and it was a healthy mid-sized market. I began by approaching radio advertisers that did not have jingles. I offered to write and produce spec demo's for free because I had no track record. I knocked on a lot of doors. It took me a year to get my first two sales...one was to a business that placed their own ads, the other was to a local ad agency that wanted a jingle for their client. After I had the first two under my belt and actually had stuff playing on the radio it was easier to get appointments to see other businesses. But that did not mean I did not stop doing free spec jingles. I still do it that way. It is very hard for someone to say ""no"" to you when you give them something to listen to with no obligation. It is a bitch trying to get a deposit upfront for something they have a chance of liking. this was much harder in my startup days (the early 80's) because there was no such thing as digital anything and doing multi-track stuff was really expensive because the 4 or 8 track TEAC machines were considered pro gear. And because there was no digital 'loops' or samples or anything, I had to work from scratch - that meant mic'ing drum kits and recording everything with mics. I also had to record a lot of musicians because everything had to be played live. Now I am just a one person operation with ProTools and a lot of gear. the upside to the old days was that there was no competition because there were few studios. the downside was that it was expensive to make demo's because you had to hire so many people and it took forever to do a product. Now you can make demo's for practically zero but everybody has a home studio. 
But the key is to make really good jingles and have enough marketing sense to package something up that fits a business and their image. somtimes I would be able to use a pre-existing slogan, but often I would create new or better ones and then I would make the sale because they would have to buy my jingle to have the marketing concept. This still works very well.
In a small or midsized market you can get between $750 to $2,000 for a jingle package...you have to provide 30 second and 60 second versions...with singing a the front and end, or just the front, back...and pure instrumental. The most important factor besides marketing content is a great singer. If you cant sing great then hire someone. Nothing kills a jingle sale faster than a mediocre vocal performance. Remember....YOU ARE BEING PLAYED ON THE RADIO! You are in between the nation's hottest songs and singers...you have to be at that level - especially in a larger market. 
If you sell direct to a business you keep all the money. If you are selling to an an Ad Agency you have to let them make at least 15% on the sale. Sometimes you just sell to an agency and have no clue what price they actually charged the client.
Where I really made my money is when I REALIZED THAT RADIO AND TV STATIONS PAY A 15% COMMISSION ON COMMERCIAL DOLLAR WHEN YOU PLACE THE TIME. This is how Ad Agencies make their money. So maybe you make $1,500 on a jingle. But if you make the ad and place, say $100,000 in ads for the client, then you keep the commission...meaning you just made $15,000 for not doing that much more work. However, it took me a couple of years to get a client to trust me with their entire program and then get a radio station to give me credit and agency status. It is really tough now with the big corporations owning all the TV/Radio/Cable venues....getting CBS, Clear Channel, Time Warner to give you agency status is a bitch - but that is where the real money is.
But to start...do some spec demo's - put a sample reel together...get out and knock on some doors. Find the first company to trust you and buy a jingle and you not only have a foot in the door, you acutally have something on the radio. Ya know, I have zero hope of ever hearing a song that I write being played in rotation with Led Zepplin, Muse, Crooked Vultures, Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood, Jimi Hendrix...yet I hear music that I write and produce being played all the time because my stuff is on in between their songs. And I get paid for it. How many musicians can say the same? Another benefit - the stations write letters for me verifying that my compositions are getting airplay - I send that off to ASCAP and get membership. If you should ever be so lucky to work in a really big market and/or sell a jingle that gets regional or national airplay you may be able to set up a royalty deal. 
The trick is to just get out on the street and sell something so that music puts money in your pocket. 
Now I am setting up to sell online and use the internet to market nationally and internationally. I have a marketing system but I am not revealing any of that yet....need to see if it will work and establish  a beach-head...but you young, savvy Reddit folk can probably figure it out. 
Still, nothing will replace knocking on doors because it is the face-to-face sales stuff that is the easiest to make happen. People prefer to buy from people they can see and talk to. The gold is in your own back yard.

That puts you in DC or Philadelphia for the 28th, and I'd say see (DC, Philadelphia, NYC) or (Philly, NYC, Boston) with a travel day between each city, and one to get home.

It's a pity train service sucks to get from Toronto to the US Northeast Corridor service (which is great) because it can be a royal pain to drive in those cities.

(If you ever hear a journalist talk about ""The Firewall,"" that's what they mean.)  There's a great deal of variation across the spectrum of US news organizations and some are much better at it than others.  The Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) used to (they may still, but I'm not up on it since I'm not in that line of work anymore) publish a ranking of US news organizations that among other things took into account the strength of their firewalls with results that would probably be quite shocking to Reddit.

When I was 19 I was enrolled in the University of Washington. I had a 3.9 overall from the last two years *I was about to turn 20 on june 3rd.

I asked my advisor if Pre-Health *med* was a viable option for me to pursue and he green lighted me to do so. I started up B-Chem, genetics and 3rd year english and settled down for the long haul. Allopathy was something I was passionate about and I had a messiah complex where I thought I cure the world...

Half way through that year I dropped out.

My father found a business position where I could work for his consulting firm in telecom. I Dropped out and worked both jobs. I started making more money than was really necessary for a child my age.

Four months after I had dropped out, I met the girl of my dreams. I have never felt so happy around someone, nor did anyone make me feel so complete.

As time wore on though, My cheerful want to heal the world attitude dissipated. I was a cruel boyfriend and a worse coworker. I had insane spending habits. I figured that as long as this gravy train was rolling, I'd lap it up and enjoy every last moment of it. Trips across the pond? Np, Spending 1k+ for a round trip to LA for a weekend to meet up with friends? In a heart beat.

I was arrogant to a fault, I figured the time I sunk into learning and being the best would off set any, what I saw as accidental character flaws from affecting my future.

I was wrong.

Two years later, I had lost everything.

My girlfriend left me for a man that was in medschool.
I lost my job due to a shitty attitude and worse entitlement issues.
I couldn't look into the past and recognize the man I saw in the reflection.

I was a twisted bitter shell of a man that had ruined anything good that had ever been handed to me.

It all happened within one week. My girlfriend broke up with me. I lost my job two days later, finally lost my home on friday.

I spent a week in capitol hill in seattle, either on the streets or couch surfing. I was broke and hungry, my family wanted no part of me because of the horrible character I had developed and from the last time I had talked to them they had condemned me. On the last day of my week long stint on the streets though, my mother called me and invited me back to her home.

I was a wreck.

The next two weeks were me doing menial drone work around her home to pay for having me around. It also kept me from killing my self. When you realize you're a horrible twisted asshole of a man with no future and no prospects, suicide doesn't seem ""irrational"".

After those two weeks though, I was tired of doing nothing. Tired of wallowing in my own filth and wondering why the bed was dirty. My actions would echo within my own life for eternity, I couldn't allow my self to drown what was left of my future.

I begged my father for money, abjectly humbled my self apologized endlessly for tarnishing his company and groveled for the chance to go back to school on his dime. Luckily, he agreed.

I talked to the University of Washington again, they rejected my old credits and told me that I would have to study at a feeder school. 

I was told this by the advisor that recommended me for the Pre-Health program.

I haggled and tried to figure out a deal so that I could return but there was no winning. I managed to get double enrollment.

Now: I'm taking a 30 credit quarter. My second of such. I have a job and my old friends that I refused to tell them what happened to me under my own detestable pride. Have helped me more and become better friends that I could ever have known that friends were capable of.

I'm happy now. All it took was my life being totally shredded and being shown the pieces of what I had become."

I did some work on this for my thesis in chemical engineering. I compared the pyrolytic destruction and the catalytic destruction of these compounds. I used an alumina tube running through (horizontally) an induction heater. For the pyrolysis I simply flowed a known amount of the gas through the tube at around the 900 C vicinity. For the catalytic comparison I used a plug of palladium coated alumina beads mounted in the middle of the tube. I used digital mass flow controllers for metering at around 1 mL/min. A trap of NaOH on the other side trapped the HCl/HBr/HF and a microGC measured what was left. I then did HPLC on the NaOH solution to complete the mass balance. A GCMS was also used for identification of hard to identify compounds. I found that the use of the catalyst reduced the temperature required for significant breakdown of these compounds and it provided good selectivity for what I was aiming to break them down into - C2H2.

Its a waterfall and the town its in just seems to be really weird and mystical and shit (no, i wasn't high).

In London, there's load of stuff to do, but I would recommend exploring Londond on the underground tube train lines. I would say to visit Camden Town which had lots of intresting markets and foods to try. I would really recommend going there because a lot of tourists don't know about it and you gotaa see it.

If you really want to experience real life england I would say to just go to random towns that aren't exact;y tourist sites and just see what the people of england are like. Hey, even come to my town, a little surburb outside of London called Shepperton. Its nice little town by the riverside where there are fields and trees and old british buildings and nice little british pubs.

Ignoring the massive quantities of food rotting in airports ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8628794.stm ), and going to waste, it's having widespread impact on schools ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7607904/Volcanic-ash-cloud-forces-school-closures.html ), students trying to return to university ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/2010/apr/19/volcano-strands-british-students-chinese ) and commerce generally ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8625690.stm ). If this keeps up for a few more days (and thankfully it looks like we'll see a respite tomorrow at least), people would probably start noticing we don't produce enough food (and certainly not the variety we're used to).

I'm good with encouraging people to stop flying as much, especially by putting better train systems in place, but sudden breaks in transport like this are catastrophes.

Edit: Not sure how much the US people realise the practicalities of getting around Europe without a plane. I have a friend who was in Sweden, and trying to get back. They gave up waiting for a plane, and took a bus out of Stockholm at 22:45 last night. They expect to arrive in London around 1500 tomorrow. They don't live in London, and can expect a further 6+ hours on bus or train, but will probably take a break before finishing the journey.

t3_bt3gb,Michigan,3,0,3,POSITIVE,0.8514626026153564,"I've been at Michigan State for 5 years (undergrad, shoot me). I absolutely hate Lansing / East Lansing...but that also stems from being here for so long. Sadly, I'm sorry to say the only way it seems to enjoy EL however, is if you ARE an undergrad and want to party. That said...here are some tips I guess...

* **Living:** Living in Okemos is probably your best bet, it's a nice little area. It's a little further away from campus, but if you don't want to be around undergrads it is probably your best choice. Do NOT live in North, West or South Lansing. Stay in East Lansing and Okemos. Also, know that Lansing and East Lansing are two completely separate cities...there is an East SIDE of Lansing, stay away from that as well. They're not terribly dangerous, but they can be.

* **Parking:** Learn your parking situation as soon as possible at MSU. I don't know if you've been here before, but our campus is VERY large...parking is expensive and the parking police don't joke around here.

* **Public Transport:** Using the CATA bus system on campus is NOT like normal public transportation, it's used almost exclusively by students...so it's not shady. CATA also runs throughout Lansing / Okemos and is in fact, very efficient (voted #1 in the country last year).

* **Weather:** As other people said - monitor the weather daily. It was 82 last Thursday and snowed a little Saturday morning. It's not going to be that much different than PA I'm guessing though. The lake effect snow doesn't quite reach here normally, but anywhere West of Lansing expect it to be snowing almost regularly Dec-Feb. You'll need a fall/spring jacket as well as a winter coat. You won't freeze to death, it's cold but, you'll live.

* **Shopping:** Head East an hour down I-96 to Metro Detroit

* As far as East Lansing goes I guess there is a little shopping...the Meridian Mall in Okemos is basically worthless however. There's a Macy's but that's about it. Also there is the Eastwood Towne Center located about 5-7 mins north and east of MSU. There you'll find a little better shopping, movie theatre, and restaurants (P.F. Changs, Mitchell's Fish Market, Bravo, etc.). Downtown East Lansing is next to useless as far as I'm concerned as well. There is however an Urban Outfitters, American Apparel...a few other places. But for real, I wasn't kidding when I said just go to Detroit to go shopping. If you lived in PA I'm guessing you know The King of Prussia Mall...our version is in Troy and called The Somerset Collection. It's a nice mall in a nice area, it even has a skywalk with moving sidewalks! hahaha check it out when you get a chance.

* **Bars:** - ugh. I hate our bar scene. Being a grad student I'm guessing you aren't going to be out barhopping, however if you do decide to go out for a drink, I would suggest Beggar's Banquet - It's downtown EL and caters to a slightly 'older' crowd. Several grad students and older undergrads, Wednesday night is their biggest night - half off all wine all night! Otherwise, if you like somewhere a little more 'upbeat' there is Harper's (brew their own beer) and Dublin Square (Irish Pub). Both are bigger places that serve food and have big patios (Dublin &gt; Harpers IMO) that definitely get busy Wed-Sat nights. Places I do not recommend - The Riv, Ricks, Landshark, Club Rush, The Post - all have shitty service, will be overly loud, and full of drunk sorostitutes. Also, check out the Peanut Barrel - they are famous for their long islands (limit 2 because of a rumoured lawsuit). It has the looks of a dive bar but, honestly it's one of the greatest places in EL. If the weather is nice sit on the patio and enjoy the long islands or some Bell's Oberon (seasonal), it's great!

* **Getting Around:** Grand River Avenue is the north boundary of campus, and divides MSU from downtown East Lansing. It also goes all the way thru Okemos and is the main E/W thoroughfare of East Lansing. It actually runs from downtown Detroit to Grand Rapids but, that is just some trivia haha. Try to familiarize yourself with the roads here (Interstate, surface and campus) as they can be extremely confusing to out-of-towners...it's not a big city at all but, trust me people get confused very easily. Also, MSU campus without students vs. MSU campus with students is night vs. day and you do not want to be confused as to where you are going amidst that mess.

* **Lansing**: Like I said earlier, do not venture to the East side of Lansing, North or South Lansing - there is nothing. West Lansing does have quite a few chain restaurants and is not a bad area (as long as you are West of Waverly Rd.). Downtown Lansing is slightly sad, as you'd think a capital city would have a more vibrant downtown however, it just doesn't. There are a few nice places though - Troppo (very nice) &amp; Tavern on the Square are great places, definitely check them out.

* **Michigan**: Okay, I'm a little biased being from Michigan but, it's really NOT THAT BAD. Honestly, other than California, New York, or Florida, I truly believe Michigan has more to offer than almost every other state in the summer. And I'm not even sure FL should be above us. Please do not base your opinion of Michigan on the Lansing area, or any preconceived notions about Detroit. The rest of Michigan can be great (in the summer). Metro Detroit has TONS to offer, the northern suburbs are great for every lifestyle. Royal Oak, Ferndale, Troy and Birmingham are where most of the activity happens, but there is also a huge amount to do in Novi, Sterling Heights, Rochester Hills, etc. And if you know where to go and what to do - downtown Detroit actually is a great place to be for dining, art, architecture, etc. 

If you haven't noticed we are surrounded by water, so try to take advantage of that if you are here while the weather is nice. Go West though, Lake Michigan &gt; Lake Huron. Befriend someone with a place 'up north', it will not be hard to find someone. You'll hear the phrase 'up north' quite often if you are here during the summer...and whenever you have a chance to go up north - take it. It is BEAUTIFUL. I'm 23 and have spent every summer since I can remember taking weekend vacations up north as often as possible.

Also, this is the Midwest. We are not nice like people down South or out West. We aren't quite as rude as New York but, don't expect much courtesy from people here especially around Detroit.

* **Saturdays:** Please try to enjoy at least one tailgate in the fall on a football Saturday. They are extremely fun and a huge deal for us...I have never attended a tailgate down South and I hear they are also great and, I'm guessing we may not quite measure up but, we do a pretty good job. The best part about our tailgate is - open alcohol is allowed on campus during tailgate hours (usually starting at 7 AM for a noon game or 9 AM for a 3 PM game).

This list is probably a mess as I just wrote as things came to me but, I hope it helps you have a slightly better idea of what to expect. I don't know if you are M/F older/younger so it's kind of hard to suggest things, haha. If you want more info. just ask, and if you need any help or a friend once you get here I will still be here in the fall for my *crosses fingers* FINAL semester. 

Our campus is big, but it's also beautiful...and East Lansing is hard to accept but, it's not the worst place. A couple last minute things - M.A.C. is pronounced 'EM A CEE' not 'mack'. Also, get used to hearing 'Go Green!' and being ready to immediately respond with 'Go White!'."

Make some friends and take a bus to Moravia. After a day of exploration, you can find local brewery bars that have all-you-can-drink wine with your dinner at night. 

If the water is high enough, take the train 45 minutes outside of Prague and kayak down the river.

There's this huge park that overlooks Prague's entire urban sprawl. Make some friends and have a picnic there. Still one of my favorite memories. Went with my French and Finnish roommates with some Slovakian girls. It was my first week there so it still blew my mind that they sold beer at a park at ~16oz/.5L for less than a dollar.

Can't really help you out on any sight-seeing advice outside the typical tourist circuit. I got my fill my first weekend there. Maybe something like the bone church or the ""mines"" in a place like Kutna Hora might interest you, but there are much more interesting experiences to acquire.

[Rent a car](http://www.vecar.cz). Cheapest deal I found.

Get involved with [Erasmus on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ILoveErasmus). Join whatever Erasmus Prague related groups apply to you. Sometimes Erasmus organizes trips to interesting places.

Mike's Pastry was one of my favorite places (yes, I know, it is touristy), but really...their cannolis are amazing. 

If you had access to a kitchen, I'd suggest buying food at Haymarket on Saturday and making dinner together with all the cheap produce. It was a fun atmosphere and incredibly cheap.

The Freedom Trail is fun--you'll see pretty much all of downtown that way. It usually is pretty crowded, and Faneuil Hall usually has street performers (last year, they had a really good breakdancing group). 

The subway system is really easy to figure out. Use it. 

Cambridge/Somerville is the quintessential college town(s). Lots of good restaurants, pubs...not a whole lot else but drinking. 

I lived in Cambridge for two years, and am so heartbroken that I had to move away. I'm not sure what the appeal of seeing Harvard is, but it is there and usually you can hear guided tours from anywhere in the Yard and watch foreigners take pictures of squirrels. (seriously.)

If you want to shop, go to Copley Square (Green line). Newberry Street is the place with all the higher end shops. There are also restaurants/cafes that have nice outdoor settings, but it is too cold for that....

Salem might be an interesting trip. Its about a 30 minute train ride and has museums. 

Ice Cream is a must. JP Licks or Herrells. Take your pick :-)

Main public areas in town and city centres will have systems (mainly so the police can see where it's all kicking off on a saturday night and get there quickly).  Mass transportation systems (ie. train, tube, motorway network) have cameras, partially for traffic management, partially for 'security'.     I find it hard to believe that these two things aren't also generally covered by CCTV in american cities, but maybe I'm wrong.

There are also a lot of private systems that companies will install as security systems on their premises, but these are generally not actually 'watched' and serve mainly as deterrent/evidence (ie. they are a bit pointless but seemingly obligatory).

From my perspective as someone who lives in a medium sized town in a regional area of the UK, I'm never bothered by CCTV, and certainly nothing like my every move would be caught on it.

Furthermore, prices are highly regional. In area with relaxed laws and high supply (california growing regions, BC/vancouver, etc), you can get a full ounce of good stuff (4 quads) for $150-$200.

t3_btdkx,pittsburgh,6,0,2,NEGATIVE,0.6803046464920044,"i suggest Regent Square or Point Breeze, Frick Park or *some* edges of Wilkinsburg or Swissvale (assuming your work/school will be in Oakland or Downtown?)

(since your time-line is short, you may consider sub-letting from students for a couple months so you can take your time and find the right place? Pitt &amp; CMU terms end in April, so there should be lots of them looking to sublet over the summer, starting May or June.)

as for the Frick Park/Regent Square etc. area--you will pay MUCH less for a bigger &amp; nicer place, likely have a yard/porch, still be within walking distance of Sq. Hill, bikable to Oakland, possibly have shops, bars &amp; such on or near your block, AND it is one of the more *flat* parts of the city (if you bike) AND you are close to Frick Park--mountain biking trails, nice paths for walking, tennis, playground etc. i live out that way now, pay $450 (includes heat &amp; water &amp; trash) for a one-bedroom...now, my place is small by U.S. standards (although medium/big probably by NYC or Paris, etc.,) but in decent shape, great location. and so on.

(i was born 15 miles south of the city, lived in town here at various places for grad school, then left for Madison WIS and later Athens GA for about 10 years, and came back here a few years ago for a job. this city is a great rental market if you look around.)

BEST advice--check the bus lines. if you'll be working downtown or at school in Oakland at CMU, Pitt etc., you don't want to pay for parking and all the schools &amp; some businesses give free bus passes. ideally you want to be on a bus route where at least three lines come together--makes it *almost* as nice as a good Metro/subway system.

NEXT best--look at where you'll work/go to school, regardless of bus/driving, and try to live within a pie-shape wedge that goes out from there...otherwise you'll end up with a barrier/bottle-neck like a bridge or tunnel in between home &amp; work/school every day. not fun.

THIRD--news, online listings will NOT get you the best deals. pick your target neighborhoods, then come here for a couple days and drive/walk around and look for signs in yards &amp; on buildings.

FORTH--check your block at night before you sign the lease. there are parts of town (including parts of Shady Side) &amp; outlaying boroughs that are block-by-block as far as condition of the buildings, noise, loose kids, other normal urban concerns. the lines shift back and forth, too. *over all* this is a very safe city, low crime...but we do have our share of petty BS smash &amp; grab, purse-snatchers, kids being idiots, and such. not a big deal, but good to have an idea of who lives around you.

shop around--we're having some of the same housing market issues that other cities are having (tho not anywhere as bad as we're usually 10 years behind on everything here!) but anyway, i'm seeing an increase in vacant rentals over the last year or two. small landlords here *love* grad students--you can pay more, and you are more quiet, less trouble. you see something you want, you'll probably get it.

for the other questions:

*most buses right now run to about 11PM or midnight...they are having money trouble. this may change. most normal city routes run on weekends &amp; holidays, but not as often. when we get bad weather, and even for sports events &amp; whatnot, the buses get all messed up. (see my advice above about trying to stay within bikable distance, and/or being on/near a major bus artery like Forbes or Fifth for anything on the Oakland/Downtown corridor.) the problem is that 90% of them have to loop around Downtown, which is a triangle and not that large, so they get all piled up down there. and with so many hospitals here, rush hour on the Oakland arteries starts at 5AM, and about 3PM.

*28X--hands down. goes as far as CMU campus, also stops in Downtown. easy to transfer off to other lines going anywhere. free with most Uni ID's.

and--Welcome to Town! this is NOT a bad little city. us natives love to complain, and we got LOTS of really OLD people who can be a lot of fun on the bus...between the old grammas and the international students, i am regularly treated to over-hearing conversations in  Polish, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, French, etc. on the bus every day to work. i love it!

(i think most of the ""middle aged"" folks here live in the suburbs--the city is packed with young people and *old* people...takes getting used to, but i like that mix!)

but we also have a fair amount of tech start-ups, cultural initiatives, many of the same benefits of much larger cities, but with less of that crowded, rushed, impersonal thing! explore! ask people...i'm still always finding neat stuff i had no idea was going on here.

They ended up herding us onto buses and taking us to a city that was close-by (we had no clue where the city was, only that it was in Germany).  We attempted to get a refund, but no luck. So at that point we knew there was no Poland in our future, so we found a bus station and decided to visit Prague.

I might add that that was my first time on a train. Now everytime I take a train somewhere it's a legitimate fear that someone will kill themselves again. "

Getting Setup
===========

*Bank Account*

If you have a bank account, then you're set.  Otherwise, you'll need an employment letter with proof-of-canadian address and photo ID.  If you have those, you're set.

*Get your NiNo*

(national insurance number)

*Oyster*

Depending on how often you plan on traveling.  You'll need an oyster card of some sort to go on buses and the tube (subway).  This is your main mode of transport.  It's great.  You swipe to get on and off of trains.  The pay-as-you-go version is a mix of a metropass and a debit card.


*Culture*

*Do NOT stick up two fingers.  Some people consider it impolite :P

*Grocery stores are built for microwave food.  They're relatively fresh. Get used to the stores: marks and spencer, waitrose, tesco, and asda

*People drink a lot here.  So much so you wouldn't believe. Oh yes, you don't need to tip.  You buy the drinks from the bar and not order it from the table.

*Kiss customer service out the window.  People don't seem to care if you get their business or not.


*TV*
*You get free TV.  Not really free because you pay for it with taxes at the end of the year.  So you don't need cable.


*Phone*

There are loads of pay-as-you-go options.  I can live on £10 / month.  There are loads of cheap phones.  Go to carphonewarehouse and buy an unlocked phone.


*Live in*

I live and work in Canary Wharf.  It's the new financial district of London.  It's pretty expensive: say £800 / month and I'm sharing.  Where are you planning on staying?

After a week or two of nervously wobbling back and forth around west London streets, 'bugger this' said I and headed off into town one sunny Saturday.

Not sure exactly what sort of distance it came to, since my route was unplanned and largely serendipitous. It was a fairly relaxed touristy sort of ride around London - Portobello Road, Primrose Hill, the West End, Parliament, the South Bank, the Globe... until somewhere around St Paul's it became clear that the sun was beginning to get quite low. Cue a belated realisation that I was quite some distance from home and I hadn't bought a set of lights just yet.

Consulting a map later on, I think I did well north of 20 miles. Wasn't actually the plan to do so, but being ignorant of London's geography I meandered unnecessarily along the river on the way home giving me a far longer route than I needed. Did the trick, though.

Yeah... I mean compared to the whole ""Tea Party"" things (those are some *WILD &amp; SCARY* protesters) I mean the french ""unrest"" was nothing really...

&gt;On 10 November and the morning of 11 November, violence increased overnight in the Paris region, and there were still a number of police wounded across the country.[4]  According to the Interior Minister, violence, arson, and attacks on police worsened on the 11th and morning of the 12th, and there were further **attacks on power stations,** causing a blackout in the northern part of Amiens.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the night of the 14th and the morning of the 15th, **215 vehicles were burned across France** and 71 people were arrested. **Thirteen vehicles were torched in central Paris,** compared to only one the night before.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Only 163 vehicles went up in flames on the 20th night of unrest**, 15 to 16 November, leading the French government to claim that the country was returning to an ""almost normal situation"". 

That all sounds pretty ""blown out of proportion"" to me...  I mean isn't it a pretty common ""daily activity"" for people everywhere to just randomly torch a few hundred cars (even a few thousand -- big deal right? I mean they're just cars &amp; stuff) plus it's a load of laughs to cause city-wide blackouts by attacking power stations, and you know, just in general engage in riots against police, have the government declare a national ""state of emergency"" and shit like that and, well just your basic everyday pranks and stuff... loads of fun for kids of all ages!

t3_btw1j,travel,3,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9983537197113037,"I did a similar 4 week trip in 2006. Spent 4 weeks in Europe, starting in London. It was me, and a couple of buddies, and we traveled with nothing but about 50lb packs. We hit similar places you are planning on, and were even about the same ages and budgets. From London we went to, Brussels, Amsterdam, Caen (Normandy region in France), Paris, Berlin, Prague, Interlaken, Rome, Nice, Barcelona, back to Paris and back on the Eurostar to London. We took trains everywhere, and had Eurail passes. I LOVED traveling by trains, and it was a great experience just in itself. Only advice if traveling by train, even if you have a pass that gets you onto the train, make sure you make reservations for a seat. Sometimes you have to shell out some Euro, but in small amounts, and it's worth it to get a guaranteed seat. There was nothing worse than getting on full trains, or trying to find empty seats. We stayed in hostels mostly, except where better lodging was cheaper and within our daily budgets. Hostels were honestly funner, because you meet more people your age, doing the same thing you are, from all over the globe. We met lots of people, and it's a great way to figure out what the fun things and cool places to see in each town are, as you will undoubtedly meet people who have already been in country for awhile.

The Netherlands are beautiful and you will most likely love Amsterdam. Not for the whole ""lol weed urvaday"", but just because it is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been to. Heineken is one of the most delicious beers on the planet, and having always drank the bitter American imported swill we get here, it just doesn't compare to the fresh and real thing. There is water down every street, bike bells ringing everywhere, and a very relaxed and young atmosphere. We stayed at the Bulldog Hostel.

In southern France, I really enjoyed Nice. It's a really relaxed, fun, and colorful city. Lots of nice pubs a long the Mediterranean, good food, saw lots of random live bands. Great place to grab a couple Stellas, relax in the sun, shop, or just bum around town. Good times were had by all. Hung out at place called THOR Pub down by the Med. Had some great cover bands the nights we were there, and was close to the strip. Stayed in a relatively decent, cheap, hotel, near the train station. Can't remember the name.

One city not on your list, and kind of out of the way, is Prague of the Czech Republic. This was the most beautiful city I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. It's off the Euro, and if you get off the tourist path, even by a block or two, things get VERY cheap. I was drinking some of the best pilsner on the planet for like 40 cents American. It is a beautiful city architecture wise, and was the most ""European"" looking city to myself as a naive American. It's colorful, it's high class, it's cheap, it's beautiful, and there are spires and gothic buildings everywhere. Spent 2 days there, wish I had spent more. I really didn't have any preconceptions of Prague before going, and it was somewhere another friend wanted to go. Once I got there, I was in love.

Interlaken, in Switzerland was also beautiful. Unbelievable scenery. If you like hiking, mountains, fog, and maybe a little rain, this place is for you. The train rides in and out were breathtaking. Not a ton to do outside of outdoorsy things, but it is a relatively quiet, and peaceful little mountain town. There are lots of peaks and other little villages you can travel to from Interlaken, even in day trips. Gimmelwald comes to mind. The local Rugenbrau brew was also very tasty. If you haven't noticed a pattern I really like beer, and Europe was like a non stop pleasure fest for me. We stayed at The Funny Farm hostel.

Cincinnati, despite right now going through heavy heavy urban expansion, at least has maintained a sustainable economy over the last century, along with a super low cost of living. (thanks, in great part, to P&amp;G and the companies that service their needs.)

Forbes ranked Cincinnati the 7th best city in the country for young professionals a few years ago. It has also been named one of the ""Top Ten Cities That Rock"" by Esquire and in the ""Top 50 Hottest Cities"" according to Expansion Management. All in the last half-decade.

And Cincinnati is currently overhauling its downtown entertainment district by expanding the Banks project (bars, restaurants and venues on the Ohio River) and the city is about to complete a skyscraper which will now be the tallest in the city and generate ~9,000 new jobs in the next two years.

Caché is good, but since Haneke is a German and it's a co-production with many countries involved I wouldn't call it a French film. Same goes for Persepolis and a lot of the Luc Besson films (Fifth Element etc.). 

I hated Amelie Poulain, it's trying to hard to force its happyness down my throat. And what the fuck was up with Alien 4, Jean-Pierre Jeunet? That movie sucked. Yes, it's the same director, not many people realise this (I don't want to underestimate r/movies though, people here tend to know their stuff). Still, most people I know who go on and on about how great Amelie is look down on 'stupid action movies', yet fail to recognize that Amelie is, in fact, directed as an action movie, by an action movie director. The pacing, the camerawork, the hyperkinetics... 

La Haine: difficult. I have to disagree with its message, which is a pity because it's supposed realism is a selling point. It's hard not to go into politics on this one, so here's a short quote from Christopher Caldwell's 'Reflections on the revolution in Europe': ""It was considered such a grittily realistic exposé of the lives of trapped French teenagers that then prime minister Alain Juppé ordered his entire cabinet to see it. (...) Today, certain of its details appear quaint to the point of sentimentality. Its depiction of a Jewish and a North African teenager chumming it up together as members of the same street gang is particularly implausible in today's suburban France. (...) the violence of Chanteloup has become more ambitious and audacious still, and has broken out of the confines of the housing development. Marauding gangs from Chanteloup often wreaked havoc at La Défense, on the edge of Paris, and Cergy Pontoise, several train stops away. In 2006, when a twenty-four-year-old from the town was shot dead after taking a hostage during the armed robbery of a Paris outlet of the Gap, sixty hooded and armed youths launched a coordinated assault on Chanteloup's police station. Next to that, *La Haine* looks naive. It bears the same relationship to the violence of twenty-first-century France that *West Side Story* had to American riots in the late 1960s.""

So one day I just hopped on a plane and left. Ended up hotel hopping here in MN until I found this board and lodge. My rent is actually more expensive now than it was when I lived two blocks from South Beach (the actual beach). 

It's so much better though. Even with the slight money issues I have. Mostly it's because of Archie. I'm a hermit, so he's my only source of affection these days. I think we saved each other. &lt;3

t3_bu6ed,IAmA,4,0,2,NEGATIVE,0.9963339567184448,"From an American in Germany:

&gt;1) Why does Germany have such shitty produce? Basically everything I eat is frozen, or comes canned, because the ""fresh"" produce is terrible.

Where are you shopping? Does Freiburg have Turkish markets or stores? If so, try getting your produce there. Added bonus- it's often cheaper.

2) Why are Germans so adverse to working? 

50 years ago in the States nothing was open on Sunday. This wasn't because Americans were so adverse to working. It was because that was the culture. As friendly Berlin resident Pappenheimer likes to remind me when I complain about how nothing is open on the weekends, not too long ago stores were only open until 6 during the week and things were only open on Saturday for a few hours, if at all. That doesn't mean that over the past 10 years Germans have suddenly decided that work is awesome. It's because they're adjusting to a growing on-demand industrialized culture.

And Germans couldn't just start opening shop on Sunday if they wanted to- there are laws about things being open on Sundays. In Berlin for example, stores are only allowed to sell things on Sundays from 1 to 6. Once a month Netto is open during those times. In larger train stations you can usually find an Edeka or a Lidl that's open, too, for most of the day.

&gt;3) Why do Germans always make a frantic dash to the tram when it arrives?

My experience is that many Germans despise jay walking and will often give you a death glare, if not say something to you, if they see you doing it. That being said, Germans, in my experience, highly value being on time. 5 minutes late is often not acceptable. Not to mention, if you're trying to make a further connection to a train or another tram, 5 minutes can make a huge difference. 

&gt;4) How come every time I see a bike that's fallen on its side, it looks stomped to shit 

I, too, have wondered this.

&gt;5) Are Germans typically dirty people?

While the concept of ""dirty"" is pretty culturally constructed, I would say on a whole no. The flat I moved into was plenty clean. I have known people who vacuum twice a day. I've lived in two German households that were kept quite clean.

&gt;6) Why do Germans get so salty when you try to pet their dogs?

I'm going to guess because they don't want some one they don't know to touch their animal, since they don't know what you're going to do to them. Especially when they are legally responsible for everything their animal does.

&gt;9) For such a seemingly health-conscious nation, what's with all the smoking?

[This](http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1907294,00.html) is an interesting article that discusses it. Among the reasons mentioned- a lack of anti-smoking laws, a strong tobacco lobby, and tobacco advertising. 

Interestingly, at the school I work at 7th graders openly smoke on school grounds. Teachers who see them will occasionally yell at them to stop it and they'll put their cigarette out, only to wait until the teacher goes away to light up again. I'm sure kids even younger than that are smoking, probably with a similar lack of consequences.

I live in NYC and take the subway everyday and frequently hear the message ""It is illegal to beg for money on the subway.  For your safety, please do not give money to beggars.  Instead give money to legitimate charitable organizations.""  I personally agree with that message and am glad that the people around me for the most part participate by it; it reduces the number of beggars drastically forcing them to go to legitimate charities that give out food/clothing for help.  My conscience is clear when I give to legitimate charities.  If my friend asks me for money, I will give it to him/her if I can and they need it.  When some anonymous person asks for money, I will not give it to them as I do not know if it is a scam and will actually be used to help them in a legitimate way.

I am not a mod or admin and am not trying to increase their workload.  Admins do have the ability to dictate user policy however, by just setting up a new rule that the community can enforce by reporting.  If you read my suggestions, I was asking can we ban posts of people asking for money.  I did suggest an alternative ""IAmA Star-like"" system that would increase the admin's workload, but I still think banning solicitations is preferable.  

Nanny state is a loaded term.  Reddit has rules and users report rule violations via the report button.  Specifically spam, NSFW content not being labeled or in an inappropriate reddit, or other violation of the rules etc.  There could be a simple rule ""do not ask for monetary donations that do not go through a legitimate established charity.  It is impossible to verify the accuracy of your story.""  

In regard to Poe's law (I feel a little silly discussing this -- just because an idea has a name and/or internet meme doesn't give it validity), Poe's law says that for devotees of sufficiently illogical ideas can't be distinguished from a straight parody.  That doesn't apply to the situation.  Situations in the real world can quite often be independently verified or proven false.  E.g., for the recent case that made it to reddit's front page in two stories (one asking for money, the other with evidence that it is either a scam or a person being scammed), a set of phone calls to the hospital should be able to easily verify whether his wife had cancer and unpaid medical bills.

Anyhow, it seems that the community doesn't support either idea.  I just was throwing it out there.  I fear that if reddit allows people with sad stories to earn $10000+ in donations, then scammers will become attracted to it."

OK, so Hobbers, dude, I totally get where you're coming from, we don't have any way to understand what it was like to live in the 19th century from a first-person perspective. But in regards to pretty much everything you said, you are dead wrong. I don't mean to hate on you, in the spirit of this thread, I'd like to keep this civil. What you said is a pretty common point of view, but pull up a seat and let's have a chat (this is pretty long, so um, sorry.):

1) *I find it ludicrous that anyone living today feels they have any connection to historical slavery in the United States.*
I feel a connection to slavery in the same way that anyone feels a connection to historical events, especially those that directly affected their families. Of course I don't know what it's like to be a slave, but I (and I think a lot of people) find learning about their ancestors rewarding and informative. My great-great grandparents were born slaves. Everything I know about who they were exist in my grandfather's stories. His grandparents were slaves, he told me about their experiences. There's my connection to historical slavery in the United States. I also think it's important to understand the hurtfulness of what you said. You're discounting (though, unintentionally) the stories my grandfather told me and the experiences not only of my family, but of an entire chunk of U.S. history. You see how that sucks? But this isn't just about me, you managed to discount an entire chunk of U.S. history as irrelevant to our lived experiences. Does history only matter if the people who lived through it are still alive?

2) *Rather, I see it as an excuse for behaviors and personal actions.*
I agree, slavery is not an excuse for bad behavior, but there's an argument there for it *rationalizing* bad behavior. This analogy might be a stretch, but bear with me: 

Parents who beat their kids usually were beaten by their parents as children. Does this excuse them? No. Does it help us to understand why they do it? Absolutely. This also doesn't say that ""all"" parents who were beaten as children beat their kids, many strive to avoid this behavior. So, what I'm trying to say here, is there's evidence that, say, black poverty in this country is a legacy of slavery. Here's how (sorry if this gets a bit long): 

At the close of the Civil War, about 4 million slaves were emancipated in the United States. This meant that the workplace was flooded with a new population of potential wage earners. To grapple with this and Reconstruction, the South adopted legislation called the Black Codes to which limited who could rent or own property and forced them to work for below subsistence wages. And while this led to some great developments like the establishment of the Freedman's Bureau and the Reconstruction Act of 1867, there was still a substantial wage gap between free whites and newly freed slaves. General Sherman gave a military order that assigned certain sea islands and 30 miles of coastal land in South Carolina as a freedperson settlement — the so-called ""40 acres and a mule"" —- but only about 40,000 freedpersons got approximately 400,000 acres of land, which in a real dick move, President Andrew Johnson later rescinded. Now the Southern Homestead Act of 1866 gave blacks and whites alike the means to purchase homesteads in five Southern states, but in the grand scheme of things, over 99% of the 4 million freedpersons received nothing and many were forced to return to the plantations where they were enslaved to work as sharecroppers or to earn meager monthly wages. Basically, back to lives as slaves. The key difference is they could leave if they wanted to and if they had the means, which many didn't. Despite their shitty pay, millions of freedpersons fled the south and settled in major urban centers like New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, etc. Because of red-lining (the practice of excluding people from buying everything from health insurance to houses), and social and cultural reasons freedpersons settled in limited spaces in the city, aka ghettos. With the labor market flooded, and blacks still considered to be lazy and value-less workers (ironic, no?), they got the worst jobs, barely able to make enough to support themselves and their families. Any time this happens, no matter what color you are, you see an increase in crime. And it's not because poor people are inherently bad, it's because if you make $220/week at the McDonalds, but drug dealing earns you a bit more with a far greater earning potential, your choice seems like a no-brainer. So slavery doesn't excuse bad behavior, but it does explain why it happens. 

3) *There was rampant discrimination (racism?) against Irish in the 19th century, but my nearest connection to that might be a third great grandparent.*
You're right, the Irish had it pretty bad. The famine coupled with the Irish Penal Laws resulted in about 5 million Irish emigrating over an 80 year period starting in the 1830s. They emigrated to major urban centers too: New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, etc. That's right, the same places that black people moved to after Reconstruction, but I'll get to that in a minute. So, when the Irish arrived in the U.S. they experienced a lot of the same kind of racism as the free urban black people. Because of this, Irish and black people lived in the some of the same ghettos, worked side-by-side, and even intermarried. But then the Civil War brought with it the threat of the end of slavery and a potential scarcity of low wage jobs. Many Irish joined the Democratic party which was pro-slavery and often argued that southern slaves had it better than northern working whites because slaveowners clothed and fed their slaves and no one looked after the Irish (nevermind the whole whip your ass whenever we feel like it, forced rape, family alienation thing). Anyway, it is true that slave labor was more valuable than Irish labor since slaves were an expensive piece of property, so it was Irish workers who did the hardest and most dangerous labor. They formed labor unions to protect their workers but with the active exclusion of black workers which distanced them from the blacks as the lowest class and, in a sense, ""elevated"" them toward whiteness. This is not to say that being white is better than being black, but at the time (and in certain contexts today) it was better to be white than black because it afforded you more opportunities.  

4) *If people want to discuss civil rights and racism of the 20th century, by all means do so. But other than being an evolution from slavery of the 19th century, there is no reason slavery should be a consideration on its own.*
I think I agree with you here, but I also don't think I said slavery should be considered on its own, primarily because it can't. If one makes the argument that the black disenfranchisement began in slavery, that's not to the exclusion of everything else that happened afterward. The Civil Rights movement came out of Jim Crow laws enacted after slaves were freed in the South. It's part of a continuum, the way all history is.

I was backpacking in Europe with a friend. We ran into the same group of Danes in four different countries. They were exceedingly unfriendly and couldn't care at all about crossingpaths so many times; we called them the unfriendly Danes.

Next, I was taking the metro in Paris when a man steps into the car who I'd met in Tulum, Mexico. We spoke until I had to get off. 

Then, in Essaouira, Morocco, I saw a German girl who I'd met in Puerto Escondido, Mexico. I was too gobsmacked to say anything and I'd also forgotten her name. I wrote her on Facebook and sure enough it was her. After that I vowed to myself to always say something to people who I think I know, no matter how crazed I come off. "

t3_buuac,AskReddit,1,0,4,NEGATIVE,0.9953049421310425,"OK i've lived in chicago all my life. I'm from the burbs but my dad lived downtown for about 10 years on diversey, near lake shore drive in lincoln park. Chicago is a really clean city, granted all cities are dirty to a point, but chicago is ten times cleaner than detroit or NYC. The bus system is good, but the train systems are ten times faster if your trying to go from one section of the city to another (red line, pink line, ect). 

I recomend the buses if your only going a couple miles, pull the wire on the side and a ding will sound and the bus drive will stop whereva you wanna get off. You can pay cash, but theres no change so i recomend you get a buss pass or use a credit card. As for the trains there are ticket machines in the subway before you get on that you can use cash or a card to get a ticket. As for the hipster dilema, the more money the less hipster. So lincoln park is pretty ""hip"", but less hipster than say wrigley ville (which is full of basically drunk children, it feels like college). 

Chicago police are real busy, and don't give a shit, so don't expect a police that will help you solve a minor problem. For example don't talk to the homeless, because they will harras the shit out of you and the cops will do nothing. Don't move to the southside unless you want to live in a house with no yard. The south side is not actually very urban (no tall buildings), just imagine the shittiest suburb you could get. Most city workers (police, comptrollers, fire dept, ect) live in the south side because you must live in the city to work there, some type of ordinance like that. Its all the inconveince of city living with non of the perks. 

The further west you go from the heart of the city the scetchier it gets, like where ""caprini green"" used to be. The further east it gets nicer it gets like evenston (northwestern, loyalo east campus). But overall you can't tell because there are bad areas mixed in with good ones. Thats why lincoln park, as well as boys town behind it (gay duwds) are considered really nice because they are on the edge of the heart of the city. The rent there is really high so it the criminals have no place to really live around there. Have fun great city, get some uno's pizza if you still can i hear they are going out of buisness, even the sweet one in the heart of the city."

t3_bus8a,AskReddit,1,0,3,NEGATIVE,0.9738513231277466,"I went on a trek across Europe with my buddy in 2006. We stayed in the south of Switzerland, then Amsterdam, then Paris and went back to Switzerland to fly out of Zurich back to the states. While in Amsterdam we walked everywhere, never took the trolleys (of which there are many stops all over town) because we wanted to breathe it all in. So, fast forward to the last morning. We get up, finish off our...supplies...and are feeling quite fuzzy as we begin the walk to the main train station to go to Paris for a few days.  

At this point I turn to my friend and say, ""Hey man, we've still never taken the trolley. Let's give it a shot before we go."" He agrees and we walk to the closest one and who is sitting there but these two girls that both of us graduated high school with, I actually went to elementary school with one of them. After several moments of ""WTF!? What are you doing here"" we find out that they are headed to the train station too! ""Hell, where are you going?"" I ask. ""Paris, my father moved there after I graduated and we are staying with him for a few days."" I grab her ticket and see that they were seated 2 cars behind us on the same train. Mind-blowing. Also, I was particularly high at the time so it was even crazier to me. So, we go to Paris and chill with these girls the whole time and since her dad now lives there and she's been there several times she gives us the tour of all the sweet places that aren't on the travel brochures...most notably Salvador Dali's museum which was in some out of the way dead-end road and only cost 5 euro to get in and it was JUST us in there because it was in such a random spot. It was a great time.  

**tl;dr** - I ran into two people I went to school with in Northeast USA at a trolley stop in Amsterdam at 11am. Turns out they were going to the same train station to take the same train to Paris. So, not only did I run into them, we were going to the same place at the same time....halfway across the world."
t3_btw1j,travel,2,0,2,NEGATIVE,0.6478504538536072,"Easy, although depending where you're coming from, you may have to take a bus. The rail lines in Croatia are rather limited in comparison to Western Europe; if I recall correctly, there's a line through Slovenia into Zagreb, and from Zagreb south to Split and not much else. The tracks aren't in tiptop shape and sometimes it's quicker to take a bus than a train.

Once you get out of Western Europe, you'll find that a bus is usually the quicker and cheaper way to get around (and in many places, the only way to get around). Don't let the buses put you off though, they are usually quite nice and comfortable. At least until you get to Albania... but that's another story.

t3_buozv,funny,1,0,4,NEGATIVE,0.999244213104248,"Wouldn't that be great!  But no, it did not do nearly as much as it could, it was put in place where people can only benefit if they live nearby, or if they can get on one of the few buses that goes near a station.  There is only one stop along the line that has any parking, at only 600 spaces near Seatac, it is always full with people waiting for a spot, the DOT is not allowing nearby business at any stop to issue parking passes for their lots, and no bike storage lockers are in place. Thus not relieving much if any congestion of the thousands of people who commute by car or to a park and ride in overcrowded buses from outside downtown Seattle.  

If it were to be more successful they should build a huge parking garage at the Seatac location to accommodate 1000's of vehicles (like the SkyTrain system in Vancouver, BC), add some parking at all the stops, and add bike lockers at every stop thus allowing more people to avoid having to drive by car into downtown, or use a slower, more uncomfortable/less efficient bus system. 

Like many American cities, Seattle has sprawled and people commute (this isn't going to change anytime soon), the majority of people paying for light rail that could benefit from it can't use it because they cannot get to it. Not everyone could/would move near a station to utilize it, but they should not be cut off from it and have to commute via other means due to a lack of a simple parking space.

Yuck. Boston police &amp; firefighters are something else. 

But I have always felt that the comparatively large salaries earned by Boston cops keep them more or less in line as far as police brutality issues. Lot less of that reported around here compared to NYC, LA, or other urban areas.

I lived in a hotel along the red Marunouchi line, but I'll be damned if I can remember which station it was. I also remember it actually took a while to realize that the Toei and Tokyo Metro line weren't actually connected, that we had to buy separate tickets to ride them.

t3_bu4tz,travel,1,0,6,NEGATIVE,0.9886811971664429,"I don't believe a travel writer as we once knew it has much of a future. There are so many people trying to do it and live some theoretical dream that there's no money in it basically, people as this thread has implied are willing to do it part time and for not much money.

But can you make money while travelling? Well there is a different story perhaps. People are still spending the same amount of money on travelling, perhaps more, it's just that the net has replaced, as it has replaced most media related things the previous business model. Which was more or less

1) Writer writes travel related piece
2) magazine find ads to go with travel related piece
3) publish

Well we know that kind of market is declining, the online equivalents? Blogs and the like, now I do think you can make money here, but it's different from how it was done previously.

Maybe what you need to do is write a destination guide, as good as the lonely planet, or roughguides, better perhaps! Because you have infinite space, you've got a website, you build a destination guide, in depth on hotels, restaurants, where the airport is, how to get from the train station to the metro, how to use the metro system e.t.c.

You write all this up and then you get it online and you know what your destination guide is the best there is for that destination. Googles sending you tons of traffic, advertisers want on your site, the hotels want to advertise because the people reading your site might well visit, or you can setup an affiliate scheme with one of the hotel booking engines and if someone stays at a hotel you recommend you get a cut. What you've got there is a piece of online real estate, a big honking billboard that all the people going to your destination are going to see and murmer, hmmm maybe I will stay at the Marriott because this guy obviously knows what he's talking about.

And there is a whole fucking world of places you could do this for instead of a huge site like the Lonely Planet which tries to cram every destination in the world into itself you could just focus on one at a time, and do it better. Instead of doing a whole country, just do it one city at a time, that way you can refine and improve, figure out what makes money and what doesn't. And one day once you've got enough sites up for enough destinations your making money in your sleep... or on the boat down the Mekong, or riding on the tube in London. Maybe all you've got  do is look at what worked before in the offline world and translate it to the online one..."
t3_buqdw,WTF,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9937586784362793,"London is far older than New York and has many of the same issues you mentioned but is still quite bike friendly in comparison. It seems like your current and past Mayors absolutely despise bikes and the cops hate them even more.

I have never been to New York but it seems to me that the only efficient way of getting around is by the subway or bike. Lack of bike lanes I can understand, but hardly any bike racks and cops that hate bikes that much that they steal them and dispose of them, that's just plain crazy.

In Adelaide we dont have any real freeways but it is still pretty easy to get around, and except for peak hour traffic it is still quicker to drive your own car around, in New York it seems like driving a car would quite often be the slower than a car or the subway.

If there is any city in dire need of decent bicycle infrastructure it is New York, yet the city is so dead against it its not funny."

Excuse me for sounding daft, but at what point did any part of this arrangement seem like a good idea?"
t3_butn4,IAmA,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9983811378479004,"Hi, thanks for your questions. :)

&gt; Never understood this argument, seems like you are just skirting the issue on a technicality.. What do you think should be the law in your state?

I don't think this is a technicality, in fact, I think this is an example of what makes our federalist system really great. There's really no reason for the federal legislature to get its hands on this issue. Given that the people of Alabama, for instance, are probably going to have very different opinions about the issue than, say, of Massachusetts, we should let them determine for themselves how they want this to work.

As for my state, I would probably be in favor of making abortions illegal. It likely wouldn't matter because it would never pass in my state. From a purely medical standpoint, I think the idea that life begins when we can see it is a little silly. The child may not be able to talk, may not even have fingernails yet, but I think as a human it should have certain rights. One of those rights would be protection from being killed.

But like I said, I think there's a thousand arguments for the other side on this issue that are legitimate claims. What if giving birth would would harm or potentially be fatal to the mother? What if she was raped? Moreover, even if the child is a living human that has rights, perhaps pre-natal humans should be something between the mother and the child alone and government shouldn't decide rights and legal authority at that point. This is why my opinion on this issue is not very strong and frankly, I just don't see an answer to this question. It's very much like a chicken-or-the-egg problem, *there is no answer*.

&gt; Public/private school? Loans? Scholarships?

You might see the [latter half of this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/butn4/iaman_18_year_old_agnostic_new_englander/c0oohr1). Basically, I attend a Canadian institution for two reasons: It was slightly cheaper than most out of state schools, and after High School, I pretty much gave up hope on the US education system. It is a public school. As an American attending a non-US school, I am not eligible for any federal grant of any kind. I received a single state grant for a couple hundred dollars. The rest is all in loans, in my name alone. My parents do not contribute. My total school expenses total roughly 30k per year, without subtracting the money that I earn working as many hours as legally permitted at a part-time job. Canadians would pay about a third that cost at the same school.

While I am against putting more government in most areas of life, I think free education and research is something that government should be playing a major role in. This somewhat of an atypical position as a conservative, and I know that it's going to look as though I'm pulling a ""get your government hands off my medicare"" by talking about how much more we should be investing into education. 

Hopefully by reading that post that I linked and perhaps its thread, I will have been able to convince you that this is not the case. To make a comparison, in Canada, they have been experiencing a major problem in their health care system because they have such great facilities to train to become medical professionals but the best and brightest graduates leave Canada immediately to go work where the money is: The United States. By having education be of poor quality and very expensive, we're creating our own brain drain-- we're sending a lot of really bright kids who would otherwise stay in a US institution outside of the country, and moreover, the kids that stay are drowning in their own debt. 

If we establish a free and well-maintained education and research network in the US, we keep (even attract from outside) great minds here, we don't drown them in debt, and more importantly, we establish a wealth of knowledge that's free to the public which would allow us to actually be able to decide what's going on in terms of say, global warming, renewable energy, and other pressing scientific issues.

I hope I've answered your question. :)"

Get off at Embankment tube station, and walk out the main exit. After about a 20 second walk, on the right before anything else on the street is what looks like an abandoned/dodgy bar.

t3_6k76c,pics,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9970648884773254,"I commend you on thinking and discussing these subjects at 15 when most people your age would be interested in other things.  However, over time you will start to see just how important the words you use and the conclusions your premises are based on are. As a PhD chemist (28 y.o.) I will spend two days trying to find the perfect way to say a sentence as to state a conclusion that I positively defend with the data presented. It is the art of saying as much as you can within the bounds of your supported premises.

There are three primary flaws in your arguments right now and it is not as much what conclusions you reach but how you get to the conclusion.


1) Focus.
Example: You will notice that no where in my previous comment did I mention religion. Right now we are not discussing religion but instead the statement “all ideologies are evil”.  Before we can compare ideologies we must first address one of your premises that I am arguing is incorrect. If you concede that “all ideas that direct one's goals, expectations, and actions are designed to willfully disregard the norms of society in ways that cause suffering, destruction, or death” is a false claim then we can move on.

Example 2: “My whole point is religion makes the same excuse and claims you make for your ideology.” Again you are trying to compare ideologies and we are not there yet. Simply comparing secular vs asecular ideologies adds no support to your claim that “all ideologies are evil”. Negate those comparisons from your reply when you try to support your claim.


2) Sticking to the definition.
First ideology (from wiki): a set of ideas that directs one's goals, expectations, and actions. I gave this definition as a means to establish what our use of the word ideology is.  Every time one of us uses the word ideology we must be able to insert the definition in the sentence. Conservation and recycling are ideologies. The idea that we can make used materials into new products to prevent waste of potentially useful materials or the protection of all the species in an ecosystem with a strong focus on the natural environment are both ideas that directs one's goals, expectations, and actions. It is the very definition of ideology. People actions are influenced by conservationism. Even separating your recycling from normal trash or changing the kind of car you buy are actions being changed by a persons ideology. For you to support your original claim that “all ideologies are evil” you must show me that conservationism is ALWAYS the willful disregard of the norms of society in ways that cause suffering, destruction, or death. From wiki: Evil is willful disregard of the norms of society in ways that cause suffering, destruction, or death.





3) Making conclusions based on false premises.
You have made the conclusion that secularism is evil because some secular governments are evil. There causal link (premise) in this conclusion that has not been supported. Basically your logical train is this: 1) Under Sadams regime Iraq had a secular government. 2) Under Sadams regime many evil things occur. 3) Therefore secularism is ALWAYS evil. The premise that you have not explicitly stated but is necessary is that the evil that occurred was the direct result of a secular ideology. I can make the same logical fallacy. 1) Norway, Sweden, Denmark are secular. 2) They have the [healthiest and happiest](http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=893) people in the world. 3) Therefore secularism results in happiness. Using a false premise to support your conclusion negates the conclusion entirely. For example: 1) Swans feathers are colored. 2) I have seen a black swan. 3) Therefore all swans are ALWAYS black. The omitted premise is that all swans are the same color as the one I saw.

4) Implementation of an ideology is different than the ideology itself. 
Democratic ideology is a form of government. Not an ideology on spreading that government. You have again embedded a false premise in your logic train: 1) The US is a democracy. 2) The US is invading other countries to spread democracy. 3) invading other countries is ALWAYS evil. 4) Therefore democracy is ALWAYS evil.  Embedded claims: 1) democracy requires the invasion of other countries. All I need is one of the other democracies that do not invade other countries to destroy that premise and negate the conclusion. 2) Invading other countries is always evil. Even your argument that Hitler invading other countries was good in some sense destroys this premise. Your conclusion that democracy is ALWAYS evil is not supported.

If you are now willing to admit that not “all ideologies are evil” then we can move on. The next step would be to compare different ideologies (religion vs secularism vs democracy). Keep in mind that a person can hold several different ideologies, several different ideas that direct one's goals, expectations, and actions.  It is very obvious that not all ideologies are equally good for humanity. I refer you to a spectacular TED talk by [Sam Harris](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html).

It is unfortunate that the arrogance of those in charge of light rail want to work for themselves and change people, not working for the people to meet our commuting needs.

Rail and Underground in London is very suited to spontaneous travel, and goes to all the major sights.

While I like Edinburgh, I think you may find five days without transport a bit constraining. The best scenery is up the west coast of Scotland, but is largely inaccessible without a car or motorcycle. Suggestion: look into taking the sleeper train up from Euston (London) to Fort William, the last main line station on the west coast. It's a classic rail route. By the time you wake up in the morning, you will be crossing Rannoch Moor and skirting the top of Glen Coe. From there you could take a further train up to Skye, or come back a little on a stopping train for some classic walking country, or perhaps get a car for a couple of days and head as far north as you have time for. Then maybe take a train back  from Fort William to Edinburgh. 

Wales is quite a way from London and Edinburgh. Depending on the part of Wales, it might take you about 6 hours to get there from either capital."

The problem is that Dawkins looks as really simple designed things. Take a look at really complex designed things, say the NYC transportation system, and you find the same kind of foolishness we find in life. Life looks designed because human design is an evolutionary process. We design things by taking existing systems, making some changes, and testing the changes.

&gt; All textbooks give the impression that Kitty Genovese was killed on the street where the murder could be seen by others. Almost all texts suggest that the 38 witnesses watched from their windows as the murder unfolded before them. 

&gt; ... All claim that nobody intervened, or called the police, until after Kitty Genovese was dead. ... not all of the 38 witnesses were eye witnesses (some only heard the attack); witnesses have since claimed that the police were called immediately after the first attack; none of the eye witnesses could have watched Kitty or her attacker for the full 30 minutes because they were only visible to them for a few moments; there were two separate attacks not three (a point which was corrected in later New York Times articles, e.g. Dowd, 1984); the second attack occurred inside part of a building where only a small number of potential witnesses could have seen it; Kitty was still alive when the police arrived at the scene. 

&gt; ... None of the witnesses reported seeing the stabbing, and Mozer (corroborated by Picq) reports shouting at Moseley enough to scare him off. Perhaps most importantly, when Moseley was frightened off after the first attack, witnesses describe Kitty Genovese as getting to her feet and walking (slowly and unsteadily) around the corner of the building on Austin Street. It appears she was trying to make her way to the entrance of her apartment, which was round the back of the building. In doing so, she went out of sight of the eyewitnesses in the Mowbray and West Virginia Apartments who had no line of sight to the back of the building. The second and final attack took place inside the building in the stairwell of 92-96 Austin Street, where none of the trial witnesses could see. The spatial arrangement of the buildings in which witnesses were located, and the site of the first and then the second and fatal attack, make it impossible for all but one of the known witnesses (Carl Ross, see Takooshian et al, 2005) to observe the attack unfold in its entirely or to witness the sexual assault and the murder itself in the stairwell.

&gt; ... As for the question of the lack of bystander intervention, there was clearly sufficient intervention to cause Moseley to abandon the first attack 1. In addition, a sworn affidavit by a former NYPD police officer, at the time a 15-year old eyewitness, claims that his father did make a call to the police station after the first attack (Hoffman, 2003). Similar claims have been made on behalf of other residents. 

&gt; ... Thus the three key features of the Kitty Genovese story that appear in social psychology textbooks (that there were 38 witnesses, that the witnesses watched from their windows for the duration of the attack, and that the witnesses did not intervene) are not supported by the available evidence

The officials said Sultan Munadi, an Afghan interpreter who was kidnapped along with his employer, New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell, was killed by a ""British sniper"" as commandos executed a rescue operation to free Farrell.

They said Munadi was targeted for possessing documents and pictures pointing at the British military's involvement in the transfer operation.

This story, in one form or another, is being repeated throughout northern Afghanistan. Dozens of people claim to have seen Taliban fighters disembark from foreign helicopters in several provinces.

These findings reveal that the Blackwaters or the Xe-Services even used the choppers to evacuate the top militant to Afghanistan. According to credible sources in South Waziristan (Pakistan's tribal area) who requested not to be named, a few helicopters were seen entering Pakistan territory from neighbouring Afghan province of Paktia, close to Pak-Afghan border which landed on Pakistani soil and evacuated Qari Hussain and a few others, then departed immediately towards Afghanistan.

I think you are going about this in the wrong way.  You just have to focus on what the law really is.  So what your focus should be on is the question of whether the defendant did reasonably believe that deadly physical force was necessary to defend himself/herself [or someone else] from what he/she reasonably believed to be the use or imminent use of such force.  And you have to take the people's past into consideration, as in Goetz who was previously mugged and beaten added to his fear in the subway (at least as was argued in court).    

The number of people involved and what they are doing are just factors to use in that analysis.

What I am saying is, do not focus on numbers.  Focus on the reasonableness.  Numbers do not matter so much as actions do.  The only thing that matters with the numbers is the fact if you attacked by multiple people the likelihood of death or serious physical injury increases with being attacked by multiple people over being attacked by one and the ability to stop or thwart the attack diminishes.

It's an interesting concept; whether it can be practically implemented is another story.

---

On a side note, I've often thought that the *chief* problem with all forms of mass transit is the fact that everyone is NOT really traveling from starting point A to end point B; but rather from starting points A, B, C, D..Z and with various end points being an equal polyglot mixture (which among other things means that the vehicle has to have ""extra"" capacity that will only be used over a minor part of it's route).

Thus there are significant practical limits to the efficiency of such systems (as revealed by the ""waste"" of ""high-speed trains"" to stop at multiple locations) -- and in some ways, regardless of how you design such a system, there will always be significant ""waste"" of energy/resources and/or time. (It's like any [project triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_triangle) -- fast, cheap, or good -- you can have any two of the three, but your chances of getting all three are pretty much NIL.)

And with mass transit systems that means you either have to go with multiple stops on a circuit (wasting energy in stopping and accelerating) or you need to go with some type of a hub-spoke system (with energy ""wasted"" for most passengers traveling two sides of a triangle; which is only worsened by the fact that practically speaking the ""hub"" is often located somewhere that is NOT the primary destination of most passengers, etc.)

So, by contrast while people having individual automobiles *seems* to be horribly inefficient, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is *less* efficient than mass-transport, if only because it allows people to take (relatively) ""direct"" routes. (IOW, when reading any ""studies"" comparing the two, you have to be conscious and wary of how the ""efficiency comparisons"" are actually being calculated -- for instance calculations by ""passenger miles"" sounds like an excellent metric, but may be ignoring that rather than a direct route, many passengers will be traveling twice the distance {or more} via a the circuit's route to actually reach their goal destination, thus falsely increasing the ""efficiency"" on their behalf by a factor of 2 or more)."

We could do a bake off and compare how smart our friends are, how smart we are, and how wealthy we are, but I prefer some anonymity on reddit, so I'm not going to engage there…

Depending on where you live in Connecticut, your cost of living might be lower than [Seattle](http://www.bestplaces.net/col/?salary=&amp;city1=50908000&amp;city2=55363000) (e.g., if you lived in Bridgeport), or similar to [San Francisco](http://www.bestplaces.net/col/?salary=&amp;city1=50973000&amp;city2=50667000) (e.g., if you lived in Stamford).  But in any case, even if we compared our costs of living and found mine to be higher or lower than yours, I'm not sure that it would mean much. I live somewhere nice, and if you do too, cool, but as I've said, once you have enough money not to be living in a bad neighborhood, it probably doesn't matter how much money you and your neighbors make; it matters more whether or not your neighbors are frendly, whether kids can play in the street, etc.

Finally, whether someone is “at the top of their field” is debatable; arguably no one at the top of their field would waste their time in pointless debate about money on reddit. I could list some of my accomplishments that I think would show that I'm pretty awesome in my field (as are the people I know), but that seems pretty childish.

When I lived in Seattle I was freaked out by a number of things:

1) There are no trains in Seattle (the monorail doesn't count) but the bus system actually works pretty well.  That blew my mind.  Maybe this has changed since when I lived there.  

2) In Washington, pedestrians will wait for the light to cross the street.  Even when there are no cars around.  And it's raining.  And it's 3 in the morning.  And they're drunk.  It's crazy.  They are the most law abiding pedestrians I've ever seen.  I also think they're idiots for doing this.

3) Californians are morons when it comes to the weather.  They want everything to be green and pretty but that's really only possible if it rains except of course, California diverts water from wherever the fuck it can get it and keeps everything artificially green.  Yet, despite that, when it actually does naturally fucking rain (3 days in December, maybe), the whole fucking state gets depressed and suicidal.  It's like they want the green grass but can't accept that rain is a natural part of producing green grass.

4) As a corollary to 3), Californians cannot drive when it rains.  They think nothing of driving 70+ miles per hour down the freeway in the middle of a torrential downpour.

5) Californians DRIVE their cars.  Like a lot.  Especially in LA.  Wanna know how to make a Californian happy?  Just make them drive somewhere, a couple hours away.  They love it.  Like Border Collies herding sheep.  It calms their nerves.

t3_bvoam,entertainment,5,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9989945292472839,"Younus Abdullah Muhammad claims to have converted to Islam ten years ago, which is around the same time as Yousef al-Khattab. These two individuals run the website Revolution Muslim.

The identity of al-Khattab (a New York cab driver and the website founder) was revealed to be Joseph Cohen, a radical Israeli-American Jew who ""converted"" to Islam. He posted videos on YouTube mocking the deaths of Americans including the beheading of journalist Daniel Pearl.

There doesn't seem to be any info on Younus Abdullah Muhammad apart from an interview this January in which he reveals he's an American convert. Who is he? What is his real name? Is he another radical Jewish ""convert"" to Islam?

The whole thing's fishy. Why is it the only voice condemning South Park comes from a group of converts who are neither Arab nor from a Muslim upbringing? There doesn't seem to be any other Muslims making a fuss about it.

Are they a propaganda group trying to incite anger and raise more American support against Muslims? It seems like reverse psychology. Last year they demonstrated with signs against Israel and now threats to Comedy Central. It's as if they're deliberately and knowingly trying to spread hate against Muslims and the expected consequences would be increased support for Israel and the war on terror.

Edit: One of their members (mistake: spiritual leader), Adbullah el-Faisal (Real name: Trevor William Forest), a Jamaican convert was arrested in Britain, his new adopted home country, in 2003 and jailed for four years (despite a nine year sentence) for preaching violence against non-Muslims at mosques. One of his mosque followers was Richard Reid a.k.a. 'the shoe bomber' who failed to detonate a plastic bomb hidden in his shoes on a flight from Paris, France to Miami, Florida two months after 9/11.

Upon el-Faisal's release from prison in 2007, he was deported by British authorities back to Jamaica where he was banned from giving sermons. He continued preaching violence on the internet and later traveled across Africa preaching violence in 2008. He was deported from Botswana on suspicion of recruiting suicide bombers. He was arrested again in Kenya but no country would issue a transit visa for his deportation from Kenya to Jamaica. Kenyan authorities ended up spending over half a million dollars just to send him on a private jet back to Jamaica.

Another member is Abu Talhah al-Amrikee (Real name: Zachary A. Chesser), some claim he's an American Jew. This is the one who posted death threats against Matt Stone and Trey Parker with a picture of the dead body of Theo Van Gogh, the Dutch film director who made a film with Ayaan Hirsi Ali about Islam's mistreatment of women. Ali, who was raised a Muslim and sought asylum after an attempted forced marriage is campaigning against radicalism and has 24/7 bodyguards due to death threats.

Still can't find the real identity of Younus Abdullah Muhammad. He seems to be the only person who's background is unknown. But so far, three members are allegedly American Jews, one a Jamaican. Very creepy. How do people fall so low in life?"
t3_bvnlk,AskReddit,5,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9772770404815674,"Okay, I'll bite.

(1) Bread: Regular, sliced, white bread in the United States is a result of post war mass production.  It probably has too much sugar because the large agri-business firms have been lobbying^h^h^h^h^h^h bribing our representatives to lie about what's good for us and throw our tax money at high-fructose syrup production.  Having said that, you can get wonderful ""artisan"" breads all over the place.  America, despite some of its quirks, really has an intense variety.  You only need to seek it out.

(2) Sandwhich/Food Portions etc: Sandwiches as well as soft-drink sizes have been getting completely out of control lately.    It used to be that you could go to some place to get lunch and you wouldn't pay much, but you would have more than enough to eat.  Lately (within the last decade approx) fast food places (and movie theatres) have been trying to redefine the meaning of regular, large etc to force you to buy the largest size possible of their most profitable product, sugar water.  Its gotten to the point where I never ask for regular anymore.  I always mention the specific size of drink (21, 22 oz whatever.)

(3) Flags: In general the US population doesn't fly flags unless it's a national holiday of some sort: Independence Day, Veteran's Day, Memorial Day etc.  There are slight variations on this of course.  Government buildings, schools, institutions often have their little flag thing outside.  Since 9/11 though, this country (as well as the Brits) have gone a little mad in their own ways.  Honestly I'm getting really, really tired of it because fascism, when it came to America, came carrying a cross, wrapped in a flag.

Other than that most of us love the best parts of what our country used to stand for, and it makes us a little teary eyed to think of it now.

(4) Pedestrian Tendencies: Yes, we travel on the right side and it shouldn't be any suprise that we tend to walk that way also.

(5) Conversations: I'm not sure I understand you here.  Are you saying that Americans tend to re-state their point and then jump into their own re-statement (which would be rather multi-personality) or that your expected to interupt when you are finally ready to make your point?  I've never noticed either style really, but perhaps it's part of the British reserve style of speaking.

(6) Food portion sizes.  See previous discussion.  I would also add that when you eat at home I've never noticed this.  Sure you get a healthy portion served by whoever is cooking, but nothing like the cheap restaurant behavior that, frankly, pisses me off.

(7) Medication Ads: Yes.  This used to be illegal in the States.  They changed it about 15 years ago (I think) and it's pissed me off ever since, although no more than any of the other lies that network TV spews out.  That's why I stopped watching in 2001.

(8) Weather: Well it's a pretty big country.  If you want the regional whether of the UK I'd highly recommend Seattle.  If you want stifling heat and humidity, St. Louis and Dallas are good starters in, say, July-September.  If you want extreme cold and lots of snow we always have the Minnesota and Alaska.  Something in between, well, travel and find out.  I actually like Colorado quite a bit, but it would be better with just a little more water.  Denver especially can be vey nice.  During the summer, when half the country seems to be in the middle of thunderstorms, hurricanes or tornados, as you travel west and descend out of Limon into the super-valley that is the Denver metro area, you'll notice that there's almost always a large high-pressure, clean weather pattern there.

Don't like the weather?  Travel to another city.  You need to get out more often.  :-)

My advice regarding the money is that NY will always cost more than you think it will.  Bring as much as you can but keep it safe.

So, one day, hmmm.  Get a good subway map and remember that despite their reputation New Yorkers love to give directions to visitors so don't be afraid to ask or look confused.  Someone will help you out.

Downtown:  start at Battery Park which is at the most southern tip of Manhattan.  Get on the Staten Island ferry (it's free!) to Staten Island and then stay on the boat and come right back.  You get a fabulous view of New York Harbor and sail right past the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.

After getting off the ferry, walk or take the subway about a mile up to Chinatown and walk around looking at all the cool restaurants, ducks hanging in the shop windows, live fish tanks to choose your food, stores with weird herbs, etc.  Pick a place to eat (there are literally hundreds of restaurants) and have lunch. Then walk across Canal Street into Little Italy, which is clustered around Mulberry Street.  Have a gelato or Italian pastry.

From there you can walk uptown through Soho (art galleries, cool stores) and into Greenwich Village.  Check out MacDougal Street and Washington Square Park.

Hop the subway uptown to Times Square (42nd St and 7th Ave).  Walk through there heading uptown towards Central Park.

Walk through the park a bit.  It's perfectly safe during the day and will be packed with people.  Try to find the John Lennon memorial, Strawberry Fields, but there's also a zoo and lots of paths and rock formations and interesting little buildings to check out.

If you still have time, go to either the Museum of Natural History on the west edge of the park, or the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the east side of the park.

Then find somewhere cool to eat dinner."

This is exactly what America does and has been doing for decades. Sadly it's mixed in with so much patriotic bullshit that saying anything against America's bullshit foreign policy means you 'hate the military.'

Did I say there was anything -wrong- with hating a military?  No, I did not.  This is more of your idiotic jumping to conclusions seen throughout your responses.  You seem to think I support the military.  

Newsflash:  I do not.

However, as a rational individual, I try my best to keep emotions at bay when rendering judgment over situations that I am not directly involved or have pristine information about.  I look at things as best I can through a scientific view - which means cutting out all the bullshit and looking at the core distinctions.  This is something you're failing miserably on.  Again, you're trying to inject a stereotypical view of the U.S. military into the conversation without addressing the situation itself.  You're unable to see beyond that, for whatever reason.  You've also committed a grave mistake in immediately adopting the recent footage of drone attacks and indiscriminate killings as the prime example of what the military accomplishes - without any evidence that this is indeed as common as you're implying.  

It would be foolish to think that everyone in the military was a cold-hearted bastard.  Just like it's foolish to think that every Muslim out there is considering suicide bombing because big bad 'Merica is out to get them.  Maybe some of them just want 72 virgins.  What the hell do you know?  This is the crux of your argument:  stereotyping, and then judging based on stereotypes.  Give me a break, and grow up.

&gt;Neither does a U.S marine. They're both trained to kill the 'enemy' indiscriminately and without question.

This isn't true for either case.  This is a stereotype.  It may be true in some cases, or even many cases, but it is not true for all cases.  I'm quickly growing tired of your infantile reasoning.

&gt;It's not an excuse, it's a reason. You have to be able to understand what is driving and motivating people if you're going to solve it. Blanketing them all as 'insane' and leaving it like that is a path towards ignorance.

I never said I wanted to solve it.  That is beyond the question or the statements I originally proposed.  As far as justice is concerned:  understanding is not necessary in so much as we know who did what.  And that's the truth.  Furthermore, it is YOU who has blanketed both Muslims and the U.S. military as insane.  You've stereotyped every last one of them throughout your posts - that as much is clear.  Keep trying to appear ""rational"", all you're doing is making yourself look like an idiot.

&gt;The point of terrorism is to incite fear, it's used against much larger much more sophisticated armies to scare them and to primarily scare the populace. You being scared of it yourself shows it works. However a suicide bomber killing civilians is no different what so ever from a U.S drone bomber doing the same thing. If anything the suicide bomber was 'braver' , the drone bombers risk nothing.

Thanks for letting me know everything I already know.

I am not afraid of terrorists.  I have no reason to be, at least where I live.  Given sufficient reason, I damn well might be afraid.  But to assume out of my comments that I was afraid - are you getting the point, yet?  You seem especially prone to leaping to conclusions to support your own delusional fantasy where you're right.  You're wrong.  Get over it.

Furthermore, my original statement was not about drone attacks.  Where did drone attacks come in?  Oh that's right, you injected it for no reason than to attempt to attack a strawman for which I will not be stringing myself up with.  Keep up the barrage in your imaginary argument.  Let me know when you want to talk about the original analogy, for which this entire ""conversation"" started, which is basically me pounding your fake-liberal ass into dust.  I'm ashamed that you would even want to try to group yourself in with the likes of me.  Clearly, you've a long way to go.

&gt;You think they don't believe suicide bombing is for the greater good and will result in more lives saved than lost?

Some do, some don't.  You can't judge an abstract situation by a stereotype.  And again, that's not the point, nor will it ever be.  The act itself (suicide bombing) is an act of inconsiderate, indiscriminate murder.  Jumping on a grenade is not, nor is it even close.  It's a simple concept.  But you refuse to listen or learn - you're convinced you're correct because you've deluded yourself into a false argument.  Reality is calling you back, and she's pissed.

&gt;Not at all. I'm simply taking an objective stand point as I look at both groups and the ways in which they kill each other and are trained to kill each other and realise that at a core level there's no difference between the individual soldiers fighting. It's the politics, greed and ideology behind these wars that I'm against.

Actually, the most difference IS at the individual level.  All you're looking at is a group level - stereotyping - and then acting as if that correlates all the way down to the individual.  You have no idea what the individual is thinking.  Thus, your entire argument, even if I were to argue against it which I don't feel the need to, since it's entirely outside the scope of my original comments, is moot.

I don't care what you think or how you feel.  I never asked.  And those feelings are for all intents and purposes unnecessary to express.  Again, your failure on a fundamental level.

&gt;There's no blind hatred here from me what so ever, if anything you've appeared to be the rather ignorant one.

Ah yes, I'm ignorant because I don't use tired old cliches and stereotypes in my arguments.  Grow up, please.  You're clearly fueled by hatred.

&gt;Both involve self sacrifice, both are done in the extreme conditions of war, both are taught to be noble by those doing it, both can be said to save lives, both take bravery and are seen as heroic by their respective sides and yeah both involve explosions :).

All of which are outside the context of the analogy.  Only a fool would equate offense with defense.  And that's the simple reality.

&gt;You're willfully ignoring any comparison as it simply makes you uncomfortable to think about it.

I'm not ignoring comparisons.  It doesn't make me uncomfortable to think about any of this.  

The difference is that I don't let my hatred of the military cloud my judgments.  I don't let stereotypes get in the way of objective reality.  I would just as soon defend a Muslim combatant jumping on a grenade, and rail against the U.S. military personnel ruthlessly slaughtering civilians because these actions are individual actions and must be assessed at an individual level.  There are no stereotypes that are accurate at an individual level.  That's an abstract of the definition of such.  In reality, I care not the nation, creed, sect, tribe that the individual hails from.  It's the action that makes a person.  You cannot expect to have a competent judicial system if you cannot hold each person individually responsible for their actions regardless of ""indoctrination"" (perhaps an exemption for pure brainwashing), as that merely lends an excuse, and relieves the individual of personal responsibility.  

No sane judge would send a soldier to prison for defending their comrades.  Just as no sane judge would let someone go free because their ideology says they can blow people up at random, or at all.

Now, unless you have an actual argument, I'm done with you.  You've assumed a great deal about me incorrectly, and your arguments are based on stereotypes and the loosest interpretation of relativism I've seen.  That's disregarding the ineffectual use of information unimportant to the conversation, and constantly trying to derail the topic.  I'll say it again:  grow up."

London's different because of the people there, it's extremely diverse. If you're into live music you'd be hard-pressed to find a better place to go. 

I've never had bad experiences with police in London, apparently they're a bit crazy about taking photos these days though."
t3_bvtp2,worldnews,9,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9964095950126648,"I think it's important to point out that this isn't just a trend of the super-rich it's a trend of modern civilization. Yes, the rich are the ones who have enough money to physically fly around the world - but to pretend like they are the only ones disconnecting themselves from communities is an outright lie. 

You see the exact same thing from all social classes in modern society, especially in the US and other westernized nations. Our entire idea of civilization revolves around the *individual*. Yes, the rich person hops on a plane to find joy in Paris, but the poor person does the same thing on a smaller scale. The poor person rides the bus with ridiculously loud music - annoying everyone around them - and they don't care one bit. The middle class person gets absorbed into television and dreams of escaping the way the rich people do. Everything in our culture now is about being better than everyone else. It's about being an individual, being special, being different. 

It spans all economic classes, all races, all political parties, it literally spans all of civilization. We may not have our private mansion - so what do we do? We have our facebook. We have our own ""profiles"" which showcase how special and unique we believe we are. We all want our 15 minutes of fame. We surround ourselves with people who agree with us, we dismiss people who do not. We are disconnected from our families, neighbors, and entire communities. We run away on the internet, forming groups of people like reddit. We tell ourselves anyone who disagrees with us ""just doesn't understand"". We dismiss all viewpoints except for our own. 

We blame absolutely everyone. We hate everyone and everything - yet we have no idea who we actually blame or what we actually hate. We all think we are special. We all think we are the only person in the world who can possibly understand everything - except for those who agree with us, of course. 

That's why politics has turned into nothing more than a sports game. A game where one group roots for their side simply because it is their side. That's why *everyone* from the richest to the poorest feels the same way: disconnected. We no longer have true community. We no longer have tolerance for each other. We are so caught up in ourselves that how could you expect the rich to do anything else? They are simply doing what *everyone* is doing, just with more resources. 

It's interesting to note that contrary to popular belief: humanity was not always like this. Humans were, in the beginning, a very tribal species. Much like a group of ants who band together and sacrifice for the greater good of the colony. In the beginning of this change it was a great thing. In the beginning we used our social structure to encourage people to do what was best for society *by doing what was best for themselves*. That was the whole idea of the ""invisible hand"" - and it worked extremely well for a long period of time. I'm not blaming self interest - it's not really about being selfish - it's more about the way that system has changed with modern civilization and the disconnect from society. On this much larger scale we no longer feel responsible to anything or anyone. 

We take care of our own, and that's it. That means that now our self interest is far from what I'd consider enlightened. No longer does it encourage us to do things good for society. We don't have a society anymore - we have a loosely associated group of individuals who are raised to think of nothing but themselves. So next time you see someone being disrespectful - remind yourself *why*. Remind yourself how you treat people the same way all the time (we all do). Next time you dismiss someone for being crazy or wrong, think about how they are doing the same thing to you and how it's not benefiting anyone. Next time you have a chance to help someone who needs help: just do it. Stop worrying about how ""individual"" you are. Don't care so much about what color your luxury car is, or how many bedrooms you have in your home. Stop, think, and appreciate all the things you have. Give back to the community, truly be a part of the community, and you will find yourself surrounded by people who will always be there to help you. 

People are not nearly as selfish as we claim them to be. We truly are not a group of sociopaths. We're just very misled and very misunderstood. Deep down we want to go back to the old tribal ways. Deep down we want acceptance, we want recognition, we want a *place* in the community. That's *why* we care so much about being special - that's why we flock to things like facebook - we are not being individual at all: we are begging people to pay attention to us. We are begging to be *recognized* as independent, which isn't very independent at all.

You need to eat and in NYC I understand that is difficult because it is so expensive but there are ways around this. Get dried beans at the local grocery store.

That's being elastic with the definition of context to the point where it devolves into relativism.

While strictly true, by using it to undermine the idea of white privilege you're being intentionally disingenuous about the history of race in our society, which is a part of that context. Not to mention the issues surrounding how those few people of colour who are in power get treated (or women for that matter). If one looks at the power structures of American society they remain overwhelmingly white and overwhelmingly male.

Social context can be as specific as an interaction with a particular person or as broad as the history of one's society.

White privilege, for example, is what leads people to view innocuous things or assertive minorities as being part of ""reverse racism"" (subconsciously centralising themselves, hence the term 'reverse') or what leads some to think that black people are entirely to blame for the present economic and social conditions in their communities. However, white privilege is not confined to people who would be classed as white either. I'm Latina but for various reasons, I have it in certain context.

Being well dressed with light skin, I don't get my bags searched in New York City subway stations, for example. How do I know that's the cause? Look at the debates about racial profiling. Subconsciously or otherwise we think of potential terrorists or criminals as looking a certain way. If I pass as a white-ish woman, I get white privilege in certain social situations.

[This is perhaps the most pathbreaking text on the subject.](http://www.case.edu/president/aaction/UnpackingTheKnapsack.pdf)

&gt;5. I can go shopping alone most of the time, pretty well assured that I will not be followed or harassed.

This is part of what I was describing before. The phenomenon of ""shopping while black"" is well documented, even in large cities.

&gt;7. When I am told about our national heritage or about ""civilization,"" I am shown that people of my color made it what it is.

Also broadly true, and given the resistance one finds to ""politically correct"" (i.e. more accurate and inclusive) history- or Pat Buchanan's recent assertions that white people made America what it is and no others (and thus deserved 109 Supreme Court justices who were white and male down the nation's history)- it's clear this is still an ongoing problem. To say nothing of the fact that the Texas school board has won a battle to make American history textbooks even more conservative.

Or Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's declaration of Confederate History Month in his state and the attendant outrages to that- such as marginalising slavery.

No white privilege? *Really?*

&gt;13. Whether I use checks, credit cards or cash, I can count on my skin color not to work against the
appearance of financial reliability.

In the recent financial crisis people of colour were, by implication, or overtly blamed for buying houses they couldn't afford. Not the banks, predominantly white, who used deceptive mortgage selling practises.

&gt;16. I can be pretty sure that my children's teachers and employers will tolerate them if they fit school and
workplace norms; my chief worries about them do not concern others' attitudes toward their race.

In this, if one generalises it a bit more, one finds the crux of the complexity I've been trying to describe. Privilege does not describe a life without trouble or worry. In this case, white privilege denotes, in essence, that your race will not be a factor in those troubles. Such problems might, however, be faced by minorities *on top* of their racial woes (a phenomenon I call 'stacking.')

&gt;21. I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group.

A common phenomena even today. A good deal of strain is put on successful minorities as their success (and failure, more particularly) will be generalised to their entire group.

What you seem to want to believe is what Peggy McIntosh begins this essay with:

&gt;""I was taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness, not in invisible systems conferring dominance on my group.""

Individuals, not systems, are racist and that's that. But the reality is that with racism by its nature is systemic (and most other types of bigotry) and one does not have a choice in being a woman, person of colour, trans, gay or queer, disabled, and they feel how society as a whole marginalises them or treats them differently because of this, to the point where it is hard *not* to think in group terms. Whereas more dominant groups have the luxury of seeing themselves as wholly individual, disassociated from broader groups save those of their choosing, if one feels marginalisation it's because the choice to belong to a marginalised group isn't yours. You've been defined by those who have power in society, and obviously that is not every single white or male or cis or ablebodied or Christian or heterosexual person.

But in the name of those groups this type of society has been erected. That cannot be diminished.

Individual members of those groups can also be disadvantaged. I'm abled and trans, sometimes white, sometimes Latina depending on who I talk to; a black person can also be economically well off, and male; a man can be disabled and gay. So therein lies the complexity, the [kyriarchical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy) intersections of our world.

Lastly, to the issue of where in the world one with white privilege may live... If one looks at Brazil, or Mexico, or Peru, it takes very little time to see that light skinned Latinos are hugely favoured and advantaged over those with darker skin or with indigenous backgrounds. If you look at Japan, China, and India, skin whitening cream is hugely popular among the upper classes. Watch the standard of beauty promoted in the Japanese, South Korean, Chinese, or Indian medias.

Whatever they once were, centuries of colonialism and the dominance of the (white dominated) West is now having its effect in these countries. Witness also the vastly divergent experiences of say a brown person in South Korea versus a white person. Foreigners of all stripes may be looked askance at but there is a *very* clear hierarchy which is determined by whiteness.

These privileges, the ability for one's skin to be seen as normal, default, and even beautiful or something to aspire to, are real. Even on a global scale.

Society varies widely but certain privileges can be constant. Some elements of white and male privilege- though not all- fit into that vein. Just as economic privilege grants one advantages across many different societies and cultures.

We're in a time of flux, certainly, where things are beginning to fray and change. Privilege is no longer as monolithic as it was, indeed there are types of male and white privilege women and people of colour can now access because of these changes, but the fact that such groups are still seen as worth aspiring to be like is part of the ongoing problem and the troubles faced by individuals, while not unimportant, do not erase that dynamic as a social force in several societies."

t3_bvx2z,news,-4,0,3,NEGATIVE,0.9964545965194702,"There is a way to get unlimited subway rides on the New York subway system for only $27 . Wait 3 days after the first new moon following Walpurgis night. 5 Minutes before midnight, begin at 13th and Broadway. You should see a man behind the counter at Forbidden Planet, stare directly at him until you see a reaction. You must keep eye contact no matter what horrific images of your fears or the fears of others you see. If you break eye-contact, your retinas will detach but you will see the shadows and hear the screaming of the lost souls doomed to walk the streets of New York City, nothing you do will block the sound or sights for the rest of your living days. When you die you will stand at the gates of hell and  meet these lost souls. However if the clerk says bring me the head of Boba Fett, then you must keep eye contact and slowly nod as the clerk turns away. Failure will cause a cyst to grow in your right ear that will whisper the horrible secrets of the universe and its undoing, your respite will only come in your eventual madness.
Once the clerk turns away from you, look down, you will see a doll whose face looks as if it were made of bone, pick it up, despite its muffled groans and squirming. Then walk briskly toward the union square subway station and count your paces. At every 72nd step turn around immediately and back again to repeat 3 times. Each time you will see an image of yourself in the past, and the future, this is where most people see a vision so horrifying that they crumple to the ground bleeding from their mouth, ears and eyes muttering about ""The all consuming sky"" . If you are spared this horrific vision then on the third turnaround you will see an old skinny man in an Ushanka ""Russian Hat,"" his name is Crazy Ivan. Stand dead still and wait until Ivan turns his back on you and walks 3 paces, now follow him towards the subway station. Crazy Ivan, true to his name, will immediately turn around and hold out his right hand, place the doll (you still have the doll right?) into his hand. Be warned, if he holds out his left hand and you give him the doll, your right arm will colapse in on itself towards your shoulder blades, you will wish death was the result but the bone fragments miss the vital organs and spinal cord and you will know the location of the fragments from the searing pain you will feel for the rest of your life.
Continue following Ivan towards the subway station. He will lead you down a maze of stairways. During your descent you will hear familiar voices telling you to stop or turn around. Do not follow their instructions, this is how they feed, turn around and you will be consumed from the legs up. If on the stairways you loose sight of Ivan continue the direction you were going or you will be lost forever and become another voice leading frugal yet naive transit passengers astray. 
At last Ivan will lead you to a subway booth whose windows are smeared with condensation and the liquified remains of the inhabitant's past meals. Approach the booth and knock on the window 3 times and call his name, Thucydides the Glutton. If Thucydides approaches the window,( a horrifying sight more a mass of human flesh and muscle turned inside out) and says nothing hand him the $27, if he greets you by your name, immediately turn around and run up the stairs and follow the exit signs. You will never see the light of day again but you will exit a worse fate of this subway station. Should you wait too long for Thucydides the Glutton to speak, 2 clawed appendages will emerge and grab you and drag you into the booth, might I mention, Thucydides may be a glutton, but he will savor his meal over the course of days if not weeks. 
After handing Thucydides the Glutton your $27 and he will hand you a key, this key will allow you entry into any and all subway stations in the New York transit system. You may now exit the station. Do not stop or go home, you must walk around Manhattan until daylight and do not retrace any of your steps. If not, you will meet Ivan again, you do not want to meet Ivan again. Rumor has it, being turned into a doll is rather painful.
You may now try your key to freely enter all the subway stations. Be cautious, if you are spotted by a person in blue, you will be taken  to an island where your name is Ruby-May and you must oblige to any and all requests of your new wife Bernie. 
However, if you are wise and vigilant, the price for those who are truly free. You can enjoy your new key. Copies are not encouraged, if you are foolish enough to do so you have the choice of whether or not to spare your friends the aforementioned perils or create a new convoluted and salvation-jeopardizing quest for them to enjoy the same advantages as you."

Right now we have the problem where entire city blocks get developed all at once (as opposed to smaller parcels within the block) - this creates mega-building complexes (see: Benaroya Hall, WaMu building, or even the Macy's and Nordstrom buildings) that completely disrupt traffic flow. You have a street lined with charming little independent shops then *wasteland* for 3 blocks. This kills foot traffic and the city needs to fight this tooth and nail.

It's not enough to demand ground-level retail from new buildings, you also need some basics:

- disallow set-backs... buildings try to ""shield"" themselves from the rabble on the streets by elevating the building from the sidewalk, or establishing complex gardening arrangements. This should be banned - it disrupts flow and creates a fucked up community. Imagine if Pike Place Market had a little garden maze up 3 flights of stairs in front of every store.

- limit maximum facade area of each store unit. Mega-stores kill street traffic, they are welcome to have big stores, but they should not rob valuable street front space from other shops.

- a completely pedestrian promenade near a major traffic stop. I'm thinking right down the slope from University Link station would work pretty well - central on the whole waterfront redevelopment, close to Pike Place Market, and already has *some* development work done for you. We do *not* need yet another lame excuse of a street mall that consists of building + small sidewalk + big ass street. We just need tightly packed buildings with lots of pedestrian space. Hell, just rebuild Pike Place Market down there and make sure that most of the businesses are actually useful to local residents and *bam*."

The main variable that you can change is the type of cover (if you're going for the bike that you posted previously, it's probably only worth getting TPFT) and whether the bike is garaged.

Group 7 is fairly low and about what I'd expect for what is basically a commuter bike. You should definitely try ringing a few other places.

Your bike idea seems to take an ""artisanal"" piece-work approach.  I can appreciate that, it's quite an artistic concept to dismember the undead one by one and remain nimble. 

Like I mentioned elsewhere, when the zombies come, I don't intend to stay mobile; see my plan about the tractor-attached thresher and mulcher/turf aerator.  I figure that, assuming reasonably densely packed zombies (if they attract each other by moaning, I should have a big crowd pretty soon), you could estimate 3-5 zombies mulched per second.  Let's say an average of 200 per minute.  12,000 per hour.

A semester at sea trip is very different from an independent backpacking trip is very different from an overland bicycle trip is very different from a Contiki bus tour. Not making any comparisons in value just saying that they are different.

The point is that there are many ways to experience foreign countries and cultures (IMO none is better than another) and the method of travel as a huge impact on the experience as a whole.

I spent 18 months traveling independently through Asia, the middle east and eastern Europe and though we may have been to a lot of the same places, I'm sure our experiences were very different (though neither is necessarily better). A good comparison to a semester at sea trip in my opinion are the Intrepid Tours (google them). Both allow you to see many places without having to deal with the most tiresome (and in my opinion rewarding) aspects of independent travel through a foreign country. That is: transportation issues, finding accommodation, budgeting, logistics, etc... 

There are many people on Reddit that are interested in traveling many of which do not have access to a semester at sea program.

tl:dr if you want to do an AMA about travel, it is important that you provide detail about the way in which you traveled so people will know if you are capable of answering their questions.

t3_bw372,Libertarian,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9986758828163147,"No, I do not think the minimum wage should be exorbitant. That would make us just as bad as those who profit off our labor without paying us a fair share of the profits.

The minimum wage should be enough to cover a person's cost of living, assuming living frugally (such as renting an apartment with a room mate for a reasonable rate), assuming a forty hour workweek. If there is a lack of public transportation, this includes enough to make routine car payments, as reliable transportation is generally necessary to maintain a job.

However, I erred in saying it should be higher, at least based on where I live, as I looked over calculations again and realized it's just about right here.

For where I live, you need about $1100 a month to live reasonably comfortably (apartment with room mate + car, since public transportation doesn't give you many options for a job), which comes out to a minimum wage of 6.88/hr for this area. I would round to $7/hr for the sake of giving people the chance to save up a small amount of money over time, as living paycheck to paycheck is generally a bad idea. It's only an extra $19.20 a month, but someone who keeps saving that for a rainy day will be happy they have it. At $7.50/hr, we get a bit of cushion unless we've made some poor financial choices. 

However, a place that has higher expenses needs a higher minimum wage. Likewise, a place with lower expenses can do with a lower minimum wage. In Boston, you don't need a car due to good public transportation, but rent is more expensive. I'm not sure if that's a net increase or decrease in expenses, but that should effect minimum wage in some way unless expenses remain about the same.

There is a caveat to this though. The costs I've taken into account don't account for medical bills or college education, both of which are important. If wages are to stay where they are, the costs of both of these things need to come down a lot. 

If medical and college costs  are to stay where they are, minimum wage needs to go up enough to support paying for these things. Assuming a $250/month student loan payment (very reasonable compared to what some students take out to put themselves through college), this adds about $1.56/hr. to the minimum wage of $6.88/hr. I mentioned earlier, for a total of $8.44/hr. This is a fair bit above minimum wage across the country. So currently, minimum wage supports the ability to live, but not to get an education and better your prospects for moving up. This is a problem, as it makes it so people in well-off families continue to have advantages that are difficult to overcome for the poorer class even when they do work hard. They aren't insurmountable, but they are significant. For medical costs, I don't know where to begin to come up with a reasonable idea to approximate their payment to deal with them in the context of wages. I just know they need to be taken into account.

Clearly, $1000/hr is not necessary and is exorbitant. However, being in charge and paying out a $1 to $2/hr is just as bad. Wages can be both reasonable and livable, and looking for that area is what needs to happen. It's a difficult problem to come up with a good answer to, but eliminating it altogether and letting the market sort it out isn't the answer either.

Edit: To address your point about small businesses in a more reasonable manner, I expect that a small business would have other ways to work this out. Instead of paying a wage, have the employees who get in on the ground floor as the business starts up split the profits (and losses) with the owner, and have a similar status in the company. Perhaps not as owner, but as managers and partners who reap a good (but fair) percentage of the profits with the owner, and are exempt from the laws the same way the owner is. These kinds of arrangements do exist and are legal."

Foot traffic in the city supports this - you will see throngs of people leading from the offices to the major transit stops, and little traffic anywhere else.

Macy's and Nordstrom are two exceptions to this rule - they remain open fairly late despite the fact that just about every store near them closes at 6pm. I'm not sure why they do this - I suspect more because their format encourages people to stop by after work and stay later, so thereby must remain open.

&gt;What's it like where you live? What's there to see and do? Are the people nice? Is it easy to get around? Is it worth visiting?

I live in San Francisco which is, as H.L. Mencken said, the only truly civilized city in the whole United States.  The city itself is cool, and there's awesome outdoorsy stuff to do within walking distance.  Just hop across the Golden Gate Bridge and tool around the Marin Headlands.  If you're deadly serious about the outdoorsy stuff you could even get out to Yosemite which is a *damn* fine national park.  People in San Francisco are some of the friendliest I've encountered in the country.  We like tourists although sometimes we get drunk and scare them with stories about guns because we know that freaks you out a little.  It's all in good fun though.  Check out the Bay Area!

&gt;Should we hire a car to get around? Or would it take too long to travel that way? Is there a rail line across America?

If by ""hire a car"" you mean rent a car that you drive yourself then this is probably a good idea.  If you're under 25 you should be forewarned that most (all?) car rental companies charge some steep fees on top of the rental itself to compensate for the perceived risk you represent.  How long it takes to get around depends on how much of the country you want to see and how long you've got.  We're a big fucking country so seeing tons of things in tons of different states will take quite a while.  You can see a ton of really awesome stuff in one area over the course of a couple weeks if you've got a car though.  Trains suck around here and I would counsel against riding them.  Either stay in one metropolitan area or rent a car.

&gt;I'm keen on both outdoorsy stuff but also keen to check out places like Washington D.C and New York. Chicago maybe? I just don't know!

See my comments about San Francisco.  Also, Denver CO is a fun city with sweet outdoors stuff to do.  NYC and Chicago are great towns, but getting out into the wilderness is pretty tough just because of how big the cities themselves are.

Hope you make it out here.  It's a country that'll wear you out but it's a hell of a place.

America is HUGE. With unbelievably vast empty spaces inbetween attractions. If you want to see stuff on both coasts, you'd be well advised to use a plane for some things, and just rent cars locally. Of course, if you'll have lots of time and don't care about staring at generic interstates for days on end, you could drive across and see lots of different things along the way.


I'm unfamiliar with railway access across America: most of us have never used it (and I'd assume the options are sparse). We're largely still stuck in the 1900s in terms of rail here, as we let our auto industry kill its expansion in favor of the automobile a long time ago.


I've lived in the vicinity of the Smoky Mountains National Park much of my life, and while it's nice, and you could easily have fun and find lots to do there and in the tourist towns around it, I'm not sure if it should be your first choice of destination. I personally liked Boston and some of the touristy stuff around it quite a bit when I lived there for a while. As an added bonus, you can literally walk the entire city pretty much. And there's a handy subway if you get tired (one of the precious few subways in America)."

If you are travelling between states, it might be smart to get plane tickets. it all depends on proximity. We do not have a rail line. Those disappeared when highways showed up.

1) Bears don't live in many parts of the States. Besides, generally if you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. I can't really offer advice on hiking or camping, but that's okay, because there's already plenty of that in this thread.

2) My favorite national park is either Grand Canyon in northern Arizona, or Arches National Park in southeastern Utah. Dinosaur National Monument (right along the border between Utah and Colorado on the north ends of both states) is also awesome. However, I haven't visited that many. I'd personally love to visit Redwood National Park.

3) I just moved to Vegas, and I can't really comment on much outside of the casinos and shows. It's certainly an experience. Just don't spend too much gambling. It's relatively easy to get around: Traffic is pretty bad on the Strip, but it's okay elsewhere. There are other ways to get around the Strip, though; there's above-ground walkways to facilitate pedestrian travel, and monorails between various hotel/casinos. The bus system is also supposed to be pretty decent, though I've never tried it. As for the poeple, well, people are pretty much the same all over. Some are nice, and some aren't.

4) If you're going to be doing any sort of serious traveling around the States, you will absolutely need to rent a car. A common problem Europeans seem to have is understanding just how huge a country the States are -- it's basically the size of all of Europe. With all due respect, I imagine that as a New Zealander, this problem is accentuated. Cities in the U.S. are spread out hundreds of miles apart, and, no, there is no cross-country rail service. The only feasible way to get around the country is by car or by Greyhound Bus, and trust me, you do not want to have to travel on a Greyhound Bus. Just to give you an idea, the shortest distance plotted by Google Maps from New York City to Chicago is [788 miles](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=new+york,+ny&amp;daddr=chicago,+il&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=34.861942,79.013672&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=6), for a total estimated journey of 12 hours, 40 minutes -- and I think that's exceedingly generous."

How do you feed Los Angeles ""locally""?

What about Mexico City, or Tokyo?

10 million people x 2200 calories  = 22 billion calories per day.

at ~ 3Mcal per ton, that's around 7 thousand tonnes of grain per day.

7,000 * 40 = 280,000 bushels of corn, which takes 2,800 acres to grow in a year (assuming 100 bushels /acre -- low, but we have no oil!)

We need that much per day for our city, so our city has a agrarian footprint of 2,800 * 365  = a million acres, or approximately 1600 square miles -- a 40x40 area.  Not so bad really, assuming that the land right close to the city is all arable, and not mountains or ocean or anything like that.

I can picture 14,000 half-ton horse drawn carts moving in and out of a city each day.  I suppose it's achieveable, but I don't see why most people would choose to remain in the city...

Looking at the picture again, IMO, the cyclist is looking to get around and has chosen a practical way to do so; the red car looks archaic in comparison and is looking for a place to park. In 20 years time, it’s the car that will look old-fashioned.

First lesson about America: It is LARGE. It takes two days to drive across Texas alone. There is Amtrak in certain parts of the country but it's not especially reliable as a rule and high speed rail is basically non-existent. The most practical way to travel between regions (assuming you're willing to plunk down some cash for comfort) is by plane, then rent a car at the airport to get around, but it's probably best to just settle on one state or metro area and stay there unless you are planning a very extended stay (say more than a few weeks).

I live in Chicago. It's the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. after New York and L.A. Culturally, it's extremely diverse so it's hard to make any generalized comments on the quality of the people. The North Side is wealthier and more white, the South Side tends to be poorer and more black, but there are dozens of little pockets that you wouldn't know existed unless you lived there -- the Puerto Rican neighborhoods on the west side, a vietnamese community on the north side, serbians around maywood, and Albany Park (a neighborhood in Chicago) is the second most diverse zip code in the country. You really could write volumes about the city, there is an enormous amount of history in this city. The American labor movement was deeply rooted in Chicago's German and Irish community. 

Anyway, Chicago is an enormous city and has become very tourist-friendly in the past decade. There are some great museums by the lakefront and the Loop itself is worth experiencing. I see it everyday so it's lost some of it's magic, but it really is a beautiful example of modern architecture."
t3_bwiek,Bad_Cop_No_Donut,11,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.6063934564590454,"Ahhh.  

Ok.  I live in Oregon.  I harvest mushrooms and truffles to sell on the wholesale market to chefs and retail stores.  Part of this whole experience is that I'm very passionate and thus very knowledgeable about these subjects.  I also have one of perhaps 3-5 working truffle dogs in the state of Oregon.

On the occasion of the encounter with this deputy sheriff, I was participating in a group truffle foray, arranged and organized by a fellow who has a ""mushroom hunting club"" that he administers from his website.  There were about 17 paying participants, some from New York and New Jersey, others from Florida, Washington and basically all over the country.  In addition to these folks, there were myself, a friend, the organizer and a friend of his from Georgia.  

I was paid to give a talk about truffles and to give demonstrations of my dog at work.  In the morning we visited a piece of property with explicit permission from the owner, who was actually present for part of the day, and everyone had a great time and actually harvested a few Oregon Spring White Truffles.  However, in the afternoon we made a trip to a piece of property where the North American Truffling Society often had group forays.  This was a piece of property owned by a timber company named Starker Forest Products, and they are generally not very friendly to foragers.

I, however, having forayed on this particular property before with a group, had no idea that we were in for any kind of hassle whatsoever.  The property isn't signed, other than the typical sign stating that this was a tree farm and ""No camping, No campfires"".  This sign implied that public access was allowed, and Oregon has statutes in place that allow for public access to all private timberlands unless adequately signed at obvious entryways. 

Nonetheless, upon exiting this tree farm, there was an officer waiting.  After considerable equivocation, I decided to approach him and get the interaction started, since waiting seemed unproductive and perhaps would be detrimental to us all.  I was very honest and forthright, considering I didn't think we had broken any laws.  I showed him the two truffles I had in my pocket, and he grilled me about who chose the spot and who made the decision to bring these people to this particular spot.

He made many treats and argued with me about the laws concerning access to the land, claiming that we were *all* guilty of trespassing, and that he could arrest us all right there.  He caused quite a scene, and scared everyone, including the children present.  He decided in the end to cite only me, since I was the one who was nice enough to approach him and answer all of his questions honestly.

His accusations, rude and condemning tone, and insistence that we were breaking several laws, when in fact no one had broken **any** laws at all were very demeaning and embarrassing. I know the laws concerning my profession.  I was cited for ""Cutting/transporting a minor forest product without a permit"" which is [ORS 164.813](http://www.leg.state.or.us/95reg/measures/hb2100.dir/hb2130.en.html).  Section 5 clearly states that Sections 1 and 2 *do not apply* if **(a) The cutting or transportation of wild edible mushrooms occupying a volume at harvest of one gallon or less**.

So I wasn't guilty.  But the guy wouldn't relent.  Even when the D.A. called him to inform him that the statute didn't apply to me, he still wanted to go to trial, because he just *thought* he was right.  It's pretty sad.  I really would like to see this guy at least notified in some way that he can't go around trying to enforce his interpretation of the law, even when it's wrong.  He was wrong about us trespassing as well.
Now all those nice people who visited our beautiful state have this feeling of being dirty, like they participated in some criminal activity just for walking around in the woods and watching my dog find two truffles.

TL;DR I got falsely accused of breaking the law for harvesting truffles.  The cop was a dick."

You mean like sweatshops, maid work, housekeeping and the like, several of which also have intersections with questions of race, class, and immigration-status which are of precious concern to a subreddit that is recently on record equivocating on white privilege and racial oppression?

A good deal of the service industry, which is something one might call neo-proletarian, is occupied by women. Feminism certainly has historically had a white cis perspective that is bourgeois; unlike Men's Rights Activism, many sectors of mainstream feminisms have at least owned up to that, with various feminisms being run and promoted by those who had previously been excluded. Issues of immigration-status, race, and class are becoming more commonplace in discussion, writing, research, and textbooks. What I see from a lot of MRAs is a fair amount of equivocation on those issues.

I and others have thoughtfully criticised how feminism still has a whiteness problem. The fact that this criticism is part of the mainstream discourse is a far cry, however, from what one sees around here.

Crypto's point was that MRAs use issues like this to claim gendered oppression yet until she spoke up no one talked about corporate hegemony or labour organisation or trade unions or indeed any issues that speak directly to the suffering of the people who work the most dangerous, physical, blue collar (and otherwise) jobs in the US and abroad.

&gt;denying the very real oppression of a huge chunk of the male population who occupy the lowest, and most dehumanizing and dangerous jobs; you know, the garbage men...

Garbage men like my father? Yes, I know all too well. I've been with him to the hospital, watched him as he slept from exhaustion, felt my heart go out to him when he came home with another scar gained from peoples' improperly disposed garbage, watched him get respiratory problems (which thank goddess are receding, he's more fortunate than some of this city's civil workers) from working to clean up Ground Zero... He and I never got along, but I always told him how proud I was of him, and I never stopped respecting him for the necessary work he did. It was not feminists who mocked garbage men, but pipsqueak kids at school and pipsqueak white guys in offices who think they're better than my father because they work in the vaunted ""private sector.""

That's why I'm as red as they come with organised labour. That's why I supported Toronto's outdoor workers' strike against the jibes of entitled citizens who don't know what it's like to haul trash in 32 degree Centigrade weather or during a snowstorm or in a torrential downpour. Or who had to hope that their parent wouldn't be the next to die in a compactor accident or crushed at the side of their truck by a thoughtless driver. People who then had the audacity to furiously type on a news website that sanitation was a job that could be done by monkeys.

I was enraged when my own city's newspapers turned on the labouring men and women who run New York City Transit, the people- mostly men- who give their lives on the tracks to repair them and our subway stations, and who rain or shine must keep this city moving. To be called ""Rats"" by two major tabloids that ran the slur over images of black striking workers, against a labour union that was run by a black man and was made up primarily of people of colour...

And the whispered racist, classist outrages that followed under the shadow of the politely evasive media.

For what? Because they dared to strike.

Yes, I'm familiar with the concerns of organised labour, with the risks these people take every day to make this country work as well as it does, and with the scorn heaped on them. Regulation, strikes, trade unions... all of these things have given these people wages and benefits that classism and racism would've seen wrenched from them. And yet in all of these dishonest discussions, what I see is a Potemkin village of oppressions.

Men work in the most dangerous jobs. But let's not speak a whisper about organised labour.

Men are overrepresented in prison. But let's erase the War on Drugs, and the institutional racism that ensures it's primarily men of colour who are in prison.

It feels shameless and disingenuous, and without paying heed to those underlying issues it feels like no one here is really interested in fixing the problems. Just in saying ""this bad stuff happens more to men! Raceless, classless men! Evil feminists!""

&gt;they're practically the only people who care about the proletariat and lumpen-proletariat who both are almost exclusively men whilst feminists bemoan the 'oppression' and 'woes' that women face in middle and upper class jobs.

Which is why this statement makes virtually no sense to me. Where are the MRAs for trade unions? Every feminist I know supports organised labour against the slings and barbs of armchair economists, conservatives, neo-liberals and other forces that truly *are* fighting against the working classes. Marxist and socialist feminisms are among the most storied traditions and perspectives within feminism.

Being a working class girl myself I'd feel *remiss* if I did not take these things seriously. What I object to is the hollow use of these serious issues of corporate abuse, graft, and malfeasance in a context-less way to somehow bash feminism.

As I have said repeatedly, NOW is not the entirety of feminism. The occasional article in the New York Times about sexism in corporate America, while valuable, is not the totality of feminism either. There's as much of a struggle with whiteness and classism in this movement as there is outside of it. Womanism was forged in those fights.

Whereas, what occurs around here is the use of racism for only one thing:

""Oh, if you said that to a black person it'd be totally racist! But it's okay to say it to a man because our culture is all feminist and PC!""

But when race is actually discussed from a 'hey, here's this bad thing that happens to people of colour' or even 'men of colour' perspective... White privilege and nothing but. So it seems strange to mock feminisms' whiteness when the house in which we're now speaking is very untidy indeed.

As well as the nonsense that all feminists talk about are female executives. Early feminism could be as varied as its descendants but several early thinkers like Emma Goldman were very sympathetic to the labour movements of their time when it was even more dangerous to be an open supporter thereof.

As to feminism's race and class issues, [they're prevalent yes.](http://bitchmagazine.org/post/fyi-world-intersectional-feminism-isnt-necessarily-anti-racist) But many feminists are at least admitting white privilege (and class, cis, abled privilege, etc) actually *exist* which is a far cry from what one sees around here. And I very much doubt that The Spearhead or some other MRA news site would even broach the topic of MR whiteness.

To take a selection of topics from Feminist Frontiers, a gender studies textbook, however:

And so on.

Yes, white bourgeois women. Totally. That's just *one* book, mind, among many. Feminism's race/culture problem is an ongoing one, yes, but I'm not the only person who's working on it. Don't erase my voice, the voices of those women, or those of many activists and academics, who are bringing that perspective to gender studies.

As I reread Ms. Darraj's work once again I can only smile at how off base some uninformed critics are about the discourses within any number of feminisms."

t3_bwddy,politics,1,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9769088625907898,"First off, you're right that the Chinese state-run news isn't akin to something like North Korea's.  I'm not saying that it is.

That said, I would urge you to broaden your sample size a bit.  I'm not big on appeals to authority, but I do live in China and can speak Chinese.  If you watch the (Chinese language) news, it's clear the narrative they're trying to promote - a decidedly nationalistic one.  When the US approved an arms sale to Taiwan, the state news went absolutely berserk; with regards to the current issue of RMB appreciation, the news paints the picture of a United States jealous of China's recent economic performance wanting to bully them for their own gain.  I could go on.

The point isn't that the Chinese people are somehow ""brainwashed"" with only state-controlled news.  As I mentioned before, you can get a far greater diversity of opinion on the Chinese language internet, and many many people do (print media can also be a decent source).  The point I was trying to make is that it seems clear to any sober observer that the Chinese state-run media has blatant biases of its own.

I think the comparison to Fox News is apt.  Does Fox News deliver the news with the angle it does because it wants to kow-tow to the Republican Party, or because its viewers demand the news to be aligned with their conservative worldview?  Honestly, you could make an argument either way, and in my opinion I strongly feel it's likely a combination of the two factors.  

The Chinese media, I think, is similar, but with the added dynamic that if you want something different than the FoxNews-esque perspective, you'd need to shut off the tube entirely."

It will be a nice segue from touring the east coast of the USA and ending up near the border with Canada. According to the [Appalachian Mountain Club](http://www.outdoors.org/conservation/trails/at/at-faq.cfm), the whole trail takes 5 to 7 months to complete. Since you are staying for about 1 month, you may want to simply complete part of it, possibly somewhere in Vermont or wherever as to minimize travel time into Canada.

As to some of your questions:
&gt; Is there a rail line across America?

Yes, there is a service is called [Amtrak](http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=am/Layout&amp;cid=1241267361971 ""AMC FAQs""). It's a decent ride and with stops in many cities, it's a good way to have a whirlwind tour of the US. For example, you can travel from LA to New Orleans, then hit up the northeast (DC, NYC, Philly, Boston, etc.) and its quite cheap and not such a hassle as compared to air travel.

&gt; What would be your choice be on a national park to visit?

Would definitely be something in the west, such as many pointed out Yosemite, or Yellowstone. 

&gt; What's it like where you live? What's there to see and do? Are the people nice? Is it easy to get around? Is it worth visiting?

I live outside Philadelphia, which is more of a destination for learning about US history. It's got shopping and tourism spots, but most things are historical spots like Carpenters' Hall or the Liberty Bell. The one spot I love to visit is [Longwood Gardens](http://longwoodgardens.org/). It's absolutely fabulous in the Spring, but their Christmas displays are gorgeous. You would need a car to get around, but there are a few gems in the outlying area.

To conclude:
+ if you want to maximize you're time visiting as much as possible, I'd recommend giving the Northeast a try. The major cities (DC, Philly, NYC, Boston) here are all very close together so you won't burn a lot of time travelling.
+ use Amtrak to get around. It's slower, but I'd say more comfortable and less stressful than flying.
+ take a look at hiking Appalachian trail for a great experience.

Most dorms will have a cafeteria of some form, generally serving only breakfast and dinner. Most will also have communal kitchens of some form, but food storage may be a bit difficult. Investigate now so that you have any idea of the set-up.

Food is expensive, to a degree. There are a pretty large number of places (Ramen shops, udon, curry, sushi, etc.) that can get you a good meal for $5-10, but this does tend to add up.

Conbinis (convenience stores) are your friend, they are everywhere and most have a decent selection of meals that you can purchase (noodle dishes and the like) for around $3-4. They'll generally heat up the food for you, so it's nice to grab while walking home.

Most universities have some pretty decent cafeterias for pretty cheap, utilize those for lunches and the like.

You can find supermarkets around, but your problem will probably be food storage rather than finding it yourself. If you can work it out though, you should be able to find some good stuff.

Tokyo is full of things to do and see, as is a lot of Japan. I highly recommend (especially early on) doing a lot of wandering. There are subway stations everywhere, so you don't need to be too worried about getting lost (even if you don't speak much Japanese). Past that try some weekend trips to Nikko, Kamakura, Hakone.

In this view, the ultimate test of validity of any phenomenon is its ability to meet the criteria of scientific evidence.

Clark's laws are intended to call attention to the persistent confusion among accomplished scientists. They lose track of the line that separates sound scientifically proven evidence from their personal, subjective world view.  When this occurs, they rail that some cutting edge advance in technology is physically impossible, when it is merely impossible within the limits of their world view."

That (or any other unwanted behaviors by cats) are rather easy to train out of them.

I didn't notice anything on the way out, but when we were embarking for the trip back home, some students started complaining a lot about the driver.

So on we went. I was sitting 2 seats behind the driver and had a good view of everything that happened.

Luckily it is quite rural and in the middle of the day there were few cars. One of the cars turned around, overtook us and made the bus driver pull in to the side.

While you shouldn't have a fixed schedule, make sure you know which items are musts and which aren't and check the availability for your musts in advance. You should absolutely stick to public transport for your trip--cars are not worth the hassle.

You say that Giverny is something you really want to do. I suspect that trip would probably consume most of one of your days in France, so keep that in mind as you prioritize. (Definitely check the transportation timetables so you don't get stuck!) If you are on a limited budget as well, you might also check in advance how much it will cost you. You could consider the Musee Rodin in Paris as a substitute and save Giverny for a future trip where you will have more time to do it justice. I don't want to discourage you from going, but be aware it will limit your time elsewhere.

My tips...Van Gogh museum is nice, but can get crowded. Just walking around Amsterdam is phenomenal. Eat stroopwafels as you walk around Vondelpark area. Walk through the red light district for the experience. In Paris, don't use the tourist buses-- the Metro is cheaper and much more flexible. Eifel tower is great just before sunset and hang around the area to see the lights at night (they flash at the tops of the hours). Sainte Chappelle and Notre Dame are beautiful churches. In general, don't plan on using your credit or debit card. Many places are cash only, and stolen numbers can be a problem.

Make your trip to Times Square short cause it's going to be really crowded and any bars or restaurants there are going to be expensive. It's cool to see but I always get frustrated with all the tourists crowding the sidewalks. If you are into art check out the Met and MOMA. If you are a student entry to some of the museums is a recommended donation and you can give however much you want to. I mostly go out in the East Village/ Lower East Side area. If you want cheap dive bars (cheap drinks but probably very dirty bathrooms) I would recommend Continental (any 5 shots for $10) or Off the Wagon which has different specials every night. There is also No Idea Bar which picks a name every night and if it's your name you get to drink for free.

As the Conservatives have been out of power for some time, the only model we can go on how a Conservative government would behave, would be to see the Mayoral office under Boris Johnson has valued the disability community. Disabled people should bear in mind the way the changes in Johnson's Mayoral office has affected transport options for disabled Londoners.

Since Boris Johnson came to power, long overdue access and equality improvements to the tube have been sabotaged, although Londoners have been using wheelchairs for more than 180 years before the tube ever existed. Of course when the UndergrounD was first built disabled people were referred to as 'invalids'. Friendly Boris Johnson has in a bid to support indefinite inequality wasted £64 million pounds of Londoners taxes by cancelling long overdue tube access improvements.  The Evening Standard reported on the 23rd of April that this move has cancelled ongoing station improvements in Amersham, Greenford, Ladbroke Grove, Newbury Park, Osterley, Shepherd's Bush and West Kensington station. If these access refurbishments had been made, then disabled Londoners as well as disabled tourists, pram users, people with heavy luggage, etc., would have been able to used them.  As of now, there is no date set to complete this design oversight. 

There have also been cutbacks in the services provided by Dial-a-Ride.  According to Private Eye (25 Dec. 2009) under Boris Johnson's leadership, Dial-a-Ride is currently failing its users. On average over 200 calls a day go unanswered, On the 23rd of October, 2009, 403 users gave up before their calls were answered. Even if users can get through to the switch board over 400 requests for transport are refused each day. Private Eye estimates that in 2009, more than 148,500 trips will be refused by Boris Johnson's controlled Dial-a-Ride this year. 

While those who are considering voting Labour should consider planned cutbacks for disabled people seeking to live independently on a national level as well as those who continue to be severely injured in the UK's misadventure in Afghanistan, leading to life long impairments."

The reality though is that they have a high unemployment rate, especially from northern africans who have fled their home countries due to the conflicts, etc.  This has led to a lot of petty crime in the more populated cities.

The first attempt was on my first trip to Paris.  I was at CDG and boarded a bus to get from the terminal I arrived at to the rail station that would take us into the city.  I was with my wife and about 8 people from my hockey team, which is bad news for the pickpocket, but how were they to know.

I had quite naively placed my wallet in the outside pocket of my backpack.  I was standing in the aisle of the bus because it was full, and all of the sudden my wife slaps the guy behind me.  I'm dead tired because of the flight, and have no idea what was going on, but my wife said the guy had his hand in my bag.  My teammates push the guy around a little and he exits the bus as it was coming to a stop.

Fast forward about two years - I am back in Paris this time with my brother.  I am fully aware of pickpockets this time and we are on the train from the airport (perhaps they target tired looking tourists on the overnight flights from the US?).  We are approaching the La Chappelle station where we are supposed to exit and I had my wallet in my front pocket and am quite mindful of the surroundings.  In this situation I was much more aware and felt a guys hand going into my front pocket right as the train was coming to a stop.   I reached down and grabbed his hand and didn't let go because I wasn't entirely sure if he already had my wallet or not.  My other hand found that my wallet was still in my pocket and I let his hand go.   He yelled at me in french and exited the train just as the doors were opening up.  About 3-4 people who I think were in his group exited at the same time.

Edit:  I should add that I am 6'1"", 205lbs and in good shape.  These guys will go after anyone, not just the elderly, etc.

TL;DR - Was a pickpocket target 2x in Paris, both at transit stations, they didn't get my money.  I was lucky 1x and mindful 1x."
t3_bxjf1,AskReddit,1,0,1,POSITIVE,0.8545250296592712,"I lived in France for a couple of years and did travel around in Germany, Switzerland and in Prague.

In those places, trains aren't too bad, but it can be very expensive (especially in Switzerland).  The train between Berlin/Prague is sloooow, but overall not too bad.

I know a friend who did some driving in the Czech Republic, he had a good time but it was a bit of an adventure.  GPS is a must as well.  I've heard driving in Germany is a pain because many German drivers are assholes.

Flying isn't too bad, but airports are always a hassle.  It's cheap though, and ultimately the quickest.  The site I always used was [www.skyscanner.net](http://www.skyscanner.net)

What is really interesting is that if you go to Budapest, you can take a river boat through to Prague, and pass through Bratislava.  I believe one company offers an old soviet hydrofoil, really cool way to see Eastern Europe.

It's a bit of a weird itinerary that you have, so you may have to mix and match a bit.  The biggest decision is do you want to spend a bit of time driving/training to see the countryside, or do you just want to get to locations."
t3_bxmnc,Seattle,9,0,2,NEGATIVE,0.9979168772697449,"The public transportation system here is decent but not nearly as good as in the Bay area. You will be able to take a bus from just about anywhere to just about anywhere but just realize that it will take time and possibly a lot of transfers. As you're researching and considering neighborhoods, look at the available bus stops and relevant timetables to see what some of your commute options might be.

As for jobs, I'm probably the wrong person to ask so sorry if this comes off a little bitter. I also have a degree in political science, an MA,and I've been out of work for over a year (since February 09). I was working in market research but as a project manager and not an analyst, so that should give you an idea; I've long since abandoned my fledgling career in favor of anything that pays decently.

It really boils down to what kind of skills and experience you have, and what you're willing to do, when it comes to how easily you might find gainful employment. The Bay area and Seattle are fairly similar climate and geography-wise, so that won't be much of a shock. We're a bit different up here, socially: do some research on the Seattle Freeze, which is debated, for example. Please come on up, but don't take any jobs from me! ;)"
t3_bxp3e,AskReddit,1,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9986205101013184,"First things first, it seems that a lot of foreign visitors have trouble realizing how big this country really is. You're probably going to want a car since our public transit isn't always the best (varies greatly depending where you are), and our sights are usually quite far from one another. Keep in mind that a trip from one end of a state to the other will take you at least 3 to 6+ hours of drive time depending on the size of the state. In other words, if you land in LA, you're probably not going to want to make the trek to the other side of the country unless you have a lot of time on your hands or you have another flight lined up.
  
  If you want the basic ""American experience,"" you'll probably be best off in New York. It's kind of what everyone thinks of when they imagine going to the US, so you might do well to go there first. I'll be honest, it's not my favorite place in the country, but I feel like it's iconic enough that everyone should see it once.
  
  As far as big cities, I prefer Chicago, but that's probably because I've spent a lot of time in the area throughout my life. Much like New York, it's packed with great sights and incredible food, but it's probably a little less iconic. 
  
  Like Daychilde said, Florida has great beaches and things can get crazy during spring break time. The gulf coast beaches are the best in my opinion, they all have bright white sand and clear waters, not to mention amazing sunsets. The Atlantic beaches are much less picturesque, but they do have nice waves, so they're quite popular as well. I doubt you'd be disappointed either way.
  
  Other than that, I'd strongly suggest finalizing which area you want to visit, then research or ask around for activities and sights. However, don't be afraid to take a day or two for simple exploring, you can stumble across some really cool places this way."
t3_bxknh,politics,2,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9994332194328308,"I think you are missing the significance of self-reliance. (i don't think) SeattleTomy is not suggesting we make arrowheads. We are capable of doing WAY more than we do right now. For example, the houses and machines that we pay people for are of lower quality and less suited to our personal needs than stuff we can train ourselves to make, for the most part."
t3_bxp3e,AskReddit,3,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9973881840705872,"I'm assuming you have about 21 days, and a budget to travel around.  I also assume you'll want to travel through the US and not just sit in one place.  I also assume you want to travel, and not bar crawl.  Expect to fly everywhere because renting a car is expensive and driving will take forever even between cities.  (ex, I drive for about 60 miles and 90minutes to get from one side of Houston to the other).  So, saying this, here would be my 21 day itinerary.  

I say, spend about 5 days in San Francisco.  Aside from the toursity stuff, you can visit Apple, Google, Mythbusters, a NASA site (Ames), and Frys, which are all probably things you're interested in given you're asking for tour advise on reddit.  In addition you can see Yosemite if you're into nature, or Monterrey/Pebble Beach if you're into quaint upscale and golf.

Then fly to Vegas and spend about 4 days.  It's a great example of stereotypical American spending, gluttony and showmanship, and you get an added benefit of getting a mini-tour of parts of the world.  See a Vegas Cabaret, walk some casinos, and visit old Vegas and learn about the mob influence.  Then visit Hoover Dam, Grand Canyon, and get chased by black helicopters at Area51, which are all ""nearby.""

From Vegas, fly to New Orleans and drive to Pensacola Beach Florida (over the course of 4 days). You'll get to see burbon street which is fun at 21, soulful jazz, some slave plantations (if you're into that) and reminants of Katrina.  Plus you'll get to experience ""deep south"" and the ""backcountry hick"" stereotypes of America in Mississippi and Alabama.  They're really not bad, and fun to talk with, which is the point of doing it.  Plus they got really awesome cajun food which you can't find anywhere else.  It's also a fun contrast to the SF and Vegas life you just experienced.

From Florida, fly to Washington DC and do the touristy capitol (white house, pentagon, memorials, etc) for two days.  Then catch a train to NY to see big city American life for 3 days.  There's too much there to mention.  An alternate to going to DC/NY is Chicago for 3 days.

From DC, spend your last 2-3 days in either Portland Oregon, Seattle Washington, or LA, depending if your flavor is hippy, hipster or hollywood.

Total airfare should cost less than $1000/each, especially if you can score tickets on southwest.  Expect to pay about $60-100/ni on hotels using priceline or discounts.  And $100/day+gas on a rental car.

If you want to just go to one place and hang for a few weeks, I say LA, San Fran, Seattle or Portland depending on if you're hollywood, techy, hipster or hippy.

I'm a Texas boy and I left out Texas because I personally don't think there's enough to do to justify the cost/time of visiting any one Texas city.  You can get the ranch/redneck thing in Australia, and the Austin/Dallas scene is fun but not unique enough to consider a 1st tier tourist destination.  In fact, I say that about all the middle states in the US.  That's why they're called flyover states.  Unless you want to game the California valleygirls near LA, I'd even say the beaches won't compare well to what's available in Australia."
t3_bximp,Dallas,1,0,2,POSITIVE,0.8510306477546692,"I'm fine with raising fares... those who want the service can pay for it.  What I am opposed to is spending gobs of money on something that few people choose to ride and subsidizing their fares simply to say that we have public transportation.

Since moving here I have taken the DART light rail twice, neither time was worthwhile.  There's plenty of parking in Dallas, and traffic really isn't that bad.  The city was built around automobiles.  

Now in NYC, I am always taking the subway.  Driving in Manhattan doesn't make sense.  "
t3_bxtos,AskReddit,5,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9971490502357483,"Flying Boston to Geneva, Switzerland via Zürich with my wife's family (8 people total).  We were travelling with skis/snowboards, along with pretty much everyone else arriving in Geneva.  When we check in my wife and I have our bags marked ""standby"" as well as several of the boarding passes for the second flight.  When we get to Zürich we find out that our intended short flight to Geneva is overbooked, but we can stay together if we take a slightly earlier flight.

After the short flight we arrive in Geneva.  We de-board the plane and make our way to the baggage hall.  It is a complete mad house.  The baggage carousels are running but none of our luggage shows up.  People are standing around everywhere.  Periodically some airport workers would push out luggage carts full of all of the excess luggage - ski and snowboard bags.  They start making announcements over the airport PA saying that there is a ""social movement"" - as in, a strike.

It turns out all of the baggage handlers are on strike.  Some of the management is pushing carts, and firefighters are chucking bags and unloading planes.  From talking to airport workers, we learn that baggage will just be coming out randomly spread out across the 4 carousels, instead of at the marked carousel.

After about three hours of walking around looking for our luggage some of our group goes to wait in the giant line at the lost luggage counter with our collection of no less than 23 baggage claims.  The airport worker is shocked when she sees the list of claims, and says that they can't even look into lost luggage unless it has been at least five hours.  She tells us to keep checking *all* the baggage carousels.

By this time the baggage arrival hall is absolutely packed full of people sitting on the luggage that *had* arrived, sitting on the carousels, a TV station was there filming the chaos.  Thankfully, shortly afterwards 20 out of our 23 bags showed up, on the carousels and on the oversized baggage carts.

We keep searching for the last three bags for the next three hours.  Finally some of us went to wait in the lost baggage line again.  This time we gave her the claim tickets for the last remaining bags.  We had to beg to get her to scan the claim tickets, she keep insisting that there was no more baggage remaining unsorted, and it looked like our stuff was certainly lost deep in the bowels of the airport.

Finally she checked the tickets.  At this point it comes out that our luggage is only just landing, having been too heavy to fit into the smaller plane from Zürich to Geneva, and had gone on a later flight.  By now the firefighters and airport management are in full form and our luggage arrived (on a random carousel...) but within 30 minutes.  The whole time we'd been searching around the airport for *three hours* waiting for bags that hadn't even left Zürich in the first place!"

t3_bxu6l,technology,2,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9974614381790161,"Ex comcast tech support agent, here.

We had some customers in rural areas that were paying $45 for 2MBit down and 56k up with dial-up return at times when people in places like Portland and Seattle were getting 20MBit down and 2 MBit up with HFC return.

2 things you should know:

1. There's no reason for the word ""megabit"" to exist other than for marketing reasons.  Bandwidth can easily be measured in mega*bytes*.  ISPs got the word from the video game industry, who used to advertise the size of their game cartridges in mega*bits* because it made them sound larger and thus like a richer gaming experience.  The only reason the word exists is because the average person doesn't know the difference between a ""megabit"" and a ""megabyte.""  So when you tell someone they're getting ""4 megabits of bandwidth"" they're thinking they can download a 4 megabyte file in 4 seconds.

2. There's a reason you have to pay the same amount for less bandwidth in rural areas.  It's because the infrastructure in rural areas can't handle the same throughput as it can in urban areas where the infrastructure is far more developed.  In rural areas the cable network tends to be entirely coaxial, while in more developed areas the cable is a combination of coaxial cable and fiber, ie HFC or hybrid fiber coax.  This means that it's fiber up to the pedestal in your neighborhood, then they run coax to your house, which results in much less signal loss.  However, it costs the same amount to maintain that infrastructure, the customer billing system, the tech support and everything else it takes to run a massive ISP in both situations.  So the cable company isn't just screwing the rednecks over because they can, they're charging the same price because it costs the same to provide the service with less bandwidth as it does with more."

t3_bxvuh,pics,8,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9905780553817749,"Again, you are projecting human traits on to a dog. Dog's are driven by instinct and don't understand the consequences of hot dog on dog action. Again, speaking in terms of evolution, it's clear that the dogs that allowed humans to use them, house them, train them, and control their lives survived much better than dogs that didn't. I don't think it's cruel to put a dog on a leash when walking him because he doesn't understand that running across the street to chase a squirrel will result in him getting run over by a car. He doesn't have a choice in the matter but as the person who has accepted responsibility for him I think it's a good move. Same thing when it comes to fixing him, it makes him less aggressive and it solves the problem of him breeding and creating more dogs that will have to be put in shelters, adopted, or killed. I honestly just don't see the comparison between the two. Dogs aren't humans. "

t3_by1um,reddit.com,124,0,1,NEGATIVE,0.9800834655761719,"I'm also in the industry, Petroleum Engineer...Anyone who complains about high gas prices and is content with America importing 70% of our current demand for oil needs a reality check. If you use alternative transportation or mass transportation then more power to you. However, most critics of the oil industry still drive everywhere.

What would happen if there was another oil embargo? Does anyone out there have any desire for America to become self-sufficient? 

 Our gas prices are still the lowest in almost the entire world and this is due to little to no government taxation on it. Other countries highly tax gasoline usage and that promotes efficiency and public transportation use. No matter what the critics say, drilling in ANWAR and offshore florida or w/e IS going to happen eventually...if not soon then within 10 years or so just for the fact that oil and gas is a NON-sustainable resource, and as our current producing reservoirs become depleted we need new sources to continue to supply the demand. Also, as the need for energy increases, resource rich nations will become more and more protective of their own resources and limit exports to ensure their economy does not falter. And production does not happen overnight. WHEN driling in ANWAR starts it will still be 4-7 years until we see enough production from that area to matter in our economy. That's a long time and demands a PROACTIVE approach to our energy needs. Just think about it.

 So if our politicians increase taxes on gasoline usage, demand will go down and the uninformed zerg complains about gas prices (omg wtf taxes?!)...that will help spur research and motivate people to buy more efficient cars (yeah you guys with the expedition and suburban...)

 And for everyone who bitches about the excessive 'profits' of the oil industry, those profits go right back into development of new fields (that are available) or extending the life of current ones (edit-Maybe not right back in, but it needs to pay shareholders and prepare for future investments and the inevitable downturn in the market. Profits are based on the developments for that year. Capital is needed for new investment, which is a future expenditure not taken into account for a quarterly or yearly statement - Now I wasn't a finance major so I may be off on some of the nitty gritty but that's the jist of it). And that is EXPENSIVE. One major oil company (can't remember which right now) is spending $4 BILLION just to extend the life of a field. Also, the oil industry is RISKY as this spill as demonstrated, but not just the environment...only about 20% of new exploration wells actually payoff what it costs to drill. And deepwater wells can cost more than $100 millions each to drill. SO learn a little about the industry before bashing it. 

I can keep going but this turned into a rant. You want sources? I'll provide some if you really want to challenge these statements.

And bp.com actually has a good statistical report on energy consumption at the bottom of their page. Check out the world oil consumption and production charts to see why we need to 'Drill baby Drill' - We rely too much on outside sources for our energy needs. I support alternative methods but oil companies are NOT alternative energy companies. They are trying to supply YOU with the power to do what YOU want (edit: supplying the demand of the market).

TL;DR Stop being ignorant about the business before you make liberal propaganda points that rarely are true or don't look past the next year or two. 
*edit-I don't get the downvotes...this is all factual. I do have a vested interest obviously, and I have tried to reply sensibly to any questions raised, but it is reddit i suppose...*
/end rant

*edit - and i'm not saying this spill is not a catastrophe...it is to the largest extent and SOMEONE fucked up bigtime. Just this should not influence energy policy except to maybe enhance safety checks and safety equipment required for subsea developments. This could have happened anywhere else in the world. And regulations preventing development of easy to access reservoirs is forcing us to drill in deep water and deep wells offshore which increases complications of engineering analysis by orders of magnitude. In comparison, it is VERY easy to have a zero-discharge land rig (like in ANWAR) and if there was a blowout on a rig it could be contained within a day or two. The restrictions on land development forcing more deepsea drilling is definately a factor for these complex wells being needed."
t3_bxkz5,Music,1,0,1,POSITIVE,0.9973773956298828,"I think one of the first that impacted me in a deep way was the song [Lost In The Stars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygkCMrC5t0Q) from the 1949 musical of the same name by Kurt Weill. It's a short and simple song that later became something of a jazz instrumental standard. I've had only passing interest in jazz and this musical was long before my time but, chancing to hear it on an eclectic radio station late one night (as an introduction to some of the instrumentals it inspired) when I was in a particularly dark mood it had much impact and it still gets me many years later.

I was introduced to the amazing music of Bulgaria by, oddly enough, Carl Sagan's Cosmos TV series and in particular the song [Izlel je Delyo hajdutin](http://www.rhapsody.com/-search?query=Izlel%20je%20Delyo%20Hajdutin&amp;searchtype=RhapKeyword) sung by Valya Balkanska, which is one of the songs recorded on the legendary golden disk sent to space with the Voyager spacecraft. This led me to an interest in other similar singers of the region like Hungarian Marta Sebastyen and then to the amazing diphonic music of the Bulgarian Women's Vocal Choir. The song from their particular album ""Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares"" (which enjoyed something of a craze in the 90s) that have greatly moved me are that really got me was [Sableyalo mi Agontze](http://www.rhapsody.com/le-mystere-des-voix-bulgares/le-mystere-des-voix-bulgares--2006) and [Mir Stanke le](http://www.rhapsody.com/le-mystere-des-voix-bulgares/le-mystere-des-voix-bulgares--2006). 

Similarly, Cosmos also introduced me to the powerful table songs of Georgia through the song [Tchakrulo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV85zrndvdY) which was also featured on the golden disk sent to space on the Voyager spacecraft. 

Another -again encountered late one night on that same radio station- is ['Round Midnight](http://www.rhapsody.com/robert-wyatt) as performed by Robert Wyatt. The roughness of this one, sounding almost like it was recorded late at night in an alleyway or an empty theater, appeals to me. Makes me think of London at night.

God, enviro-tards are so ridiculous. Oil companies are either gouging profiteers or they're making gas artificially cheap to help out some other company. 

Gas is cheaper in the US than in Europe because of taxes. That is the **only** difference between the two areas as far as gas prices go. If an oil company in Europe decided to jack up prices and gouge the consumers, the other oil companies would move in and make a killing while the company that jacked up prices sold nothing. In reality, the price is composed of [manufacturing cost of product+profit+taxes]. The manufacturing cost and taxes are essentially fixed. The profit is the only variable that an oil company can adjust, and if they adjust it too far out of line of their competitors, they don't sell anything.

Still, as the article points out, the average NYC resident consumes between a quarter and a third of the electricity that the average Dallas resident does.

And, as [this New Yorker article](http://www.walkablestreets.com/manhattan.htm) point out, dense urban living is a fantastic way to reduce energy and oil consumption, if combined with good urban planning and public transportation"

Nah I kid, just your drivers license. This really old guy mans the Guinness stand and is really cool so I don't mind, not sure about the other beer stands though. I only go to J.J Foleys down by South Station when I want to drink in Boston (they actually serve Guinness the correct way). The price is the price, it will always be more in the city at ""hot"" places than it will be anywhere else (don't quote me on this) IMO. They are probably hard-asses because of all the times they got busted serving underage people.  "

Any man that can cause a NYC subway car to sing has to be on the fast track to heaven."

I haven't had a problem, but NYC(!?) and SF are apparently problematic. DC is fine, but they don't have the Metro coverage that Verizon does. 

Any other problem spots?"

2. See what you need to see in Tokyo and then get out: Ginza, Akiharbara, Roppongi, The Tokyo Tower, the Imperial Gardens...I'd suggest 2 days and 2 nights if you're also into museums.

3. Take the train to Kyoto - stay there overnight. Be sure to visit the gardens and temples while you're there. There's also a pretty nice rock garden.

4. If you have company, Osaka is always fun. There's a huge party culture in the city and there's also an incredible ""all you can eat, all you can drink"" thing going on at cheaper restaurants. 

5. Nara - the ancient capital of Japan. It's definitely worth a day-trip. It's relaxing, calm and quiet. There are deer walking around all the place and probably the most amazing temples that I have seen (complete with huge warrior statues). Oh, and you can rent bikes for cheap!

Here are some pictures that I took once I was in most of these places.
