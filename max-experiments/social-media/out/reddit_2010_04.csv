t3_bkv6m,AskReddit,2,0, station ,"On the way home after work I was walking from the tube station when a homeless lady with a massive gut leapt out of the shadows of a dark alley way and asked me to explain what a word meant, pointing to a magazine ad about pregnancy. She stunk of booze and cigarettes and I could only think about how rancid she smelt, all up in my personal space, pointing to a pregnant lady.

I couldn't help wonder why she was asking me about this word hidden in the fineprint. My senses became overwhelmed and I started to stumble on the definition. My eyes blurred. The whiskey on her breath, the clothes stained with cigarettes showing way too much flesh on such a cold winters night. Then it hit me. The ad, the dark alley way, the loose fitted clothes, the alcohol.

The word she wanted me to clarify was conception, and she was trying to seduce (rape) me."

Also, you can do 'cable situps' as I call them, since crunch motions are today's evil. You attach a rope attachment to a high cable pulley, face away from the machine, kneel on the ground, and bend at the hips forward. (Keep spine neutral and focus on the abs, as the hip flexors can take over the movement if you are not careful)

Also, doing a lot of overhead work while standing (such as military press) will work the core to a great deal."

The vast majority of city-residing Japanese women have been groped on the train (no, that's not an exaggeration). Very, very few of them ever report it, although that is changing now.

Another type of abuse usually classified as sexual assault by these statistics is sexual harassment, which is pretty much institutionalized here in Japan -- although that, too, is starting to change."

t3_bkrk2,politics,1,0, rail ,"From memory, Drill Baby Drill occurred in the context of: 

1. an election, as a comprehensive energy strategy, along with populist schemes like a ""gas tax holiday"" which would not have worked 
2. as a *solution* to *very high petrol prices of the time* (take a moment to remember those prices),
3. Sarah Palin being touted as a energy expert, who was responsible for a gas pipeline and whose state supplied 20% of America's energy. 

IMO, all 3 above is BS. 

Anyone who thinks offshore drilling is taboo, any petrol use, any local drilling should be disappointed by Obama now. And should get on their bicycle. The reality is that most Americans drive, and energy has to come from somewhere. If American goals are to transition to renewable energy **and** be less reliant on foreign oil, then looking for oil locally goes towards fulfilling the latter goal. 

The real hypocrisy IMO is when people do the easy thing and rail against politicians, instead of advocating eating locally, riding bicycles, refusing plastic bags (some made of petrol) etc. 

&gt;I find this rather blatant hypocrisy interesting though and it only reinforces my opinion that the left is swiftly losing it's intellectual edge as more people jump on the bandwagon who have little or no understanding of the actual issues and simply follow along behind a charismatic leader with the rest of the throng.

t3_bkv6m,AskReddit,1,0, bus ,"Last week I walked to the mall (like a mile away or so) and I was walking back, this man in the parking lot asked to use my phone to call somebody. He looked like a decent guy, had a short haircut, sunglasses, had a bag from a store in the mall. Looked like a frat guy but in his 30's or so. 

He said his girlfriend left him there, and he forgot his cell in her car, so he needed to call her. No problem, he calls her, and gives me the phone. He makes some small talk, asks me if I go to college around there (it's a college town) and I tell him I do. 

Well he starts talking like he is just gonna ride the bus wherever, so he's kinda walking with me considering the bus stop is pretty much in front of where I'm staying at the time. Anyways, it's pretty dark outside, and him walking with me is kinda starting to freak me out. 

Well, he then starts talking about opening a club. Not just any club. A horror/bondage club that would offer ""therapeutic services"" by allowing people to cut up and stab human sized dolls. Talking about how going crazy is relaxing and how it can help people calm down. All the while he is pretty much staring at me and walking closer and closer to me. 

Now I'm really fucking scared.

So, I crossed at the next crosswalk, and he started following me again, when I turned around and told the man that the bus stop was on the other side of the street (it wasn't) and he should keep walking on the other side.

t3_bkq7i,science,-1,0, urban ,"sources like this:
&gt;In AD 1000, the Earth was experiencing an episode of climate warming similar to that of the present day. Temperatures in many parts of the world seem to have risen by at least two or three degrees Fahrenheit. 

&gt;Although the scale of this ""global warming"" may seem small, its effects on human societies were profound. In Europe, several centuries of long hot summers led to an almost unbroken string of good harvests, and both urban and rural populations began to grow. These centuries are known as the Medieval Warm Period. One of the more dramatic consequences of the Medieval Warm Period was the expansion of Viking settlements in the North Atlantic. From their Icelandic base (established in AD 870), the Norse people began to move west and north to Greenland, Canada, and eventually above the Arctic Circle.
LINK

&gt;The Medieval Warm Period was a time of warm weather around 800-1300 AD, during the European Medieval period. Initial research on the MWP and the following Little Ice Age (LIA) was largely done in Europe, where the phenomenon was most obvious and clearly documented. The Vikings took advantage of ice-free seas to colonize Greenland and other outlying lands of the far north.

It was a nice red brick house in the suburbs of Louisville, completely inviting,  especially with this little pixie waiting to meet me after all those months.   As we walked through the front door he calls out her name,  but there's no response,  he looked in the garage and said she must've gone to grab some food or something.   I told me I could go watch TV in her room that was downstairs in the basement.  So I go the stairs and notice this smell,  kind of like dog shit.   It was dark and I was hunting for the switch in the light from the upstairs hallway when the door slammed shit and the lights came on.   This wasn't her bedroom.   It was a completely concrete room with nothing but a wooden chair, a small black and white tv and what appeared to be feces smeared all over the wall.   After a few hours of trying to figure out how the fuck I get out of this,   he opens the door and comes down the stairs,  no clothes,  just some fucking yellow dish gloves.

t3_bkel1,depression,1,0, train ,"First off - Yay!  I'm glad you're feeling better.  Isn't this what we all want - To feel OK, to not feel depressed and burdened by compulsions, anxieties, fears, etc.?

Secondly, I'm glad to hear you're a dude.  'Cause I was feeling slightly creepy talking nice to (what I thought was a) female sex addict.  Being that you're a guy, I do hope you know that at least some of what you've described (lots of masturbation, seeking out wild sex scenarios, lots of partners) is sort of normal for a male your age.  I think the most important things to keep in mind here is threefold: 1. wear a condom so you don't hurt yourself with a disease, 2. stop beating yourself up so much for having sexual impulses and 3. find out what else besides basic hormones is driving your libido.

I'm glad to hear that your psychiatrist knows about the sex addiction, maybe you can talk to him about broaching the topic with your psychologist (therapist).  I certainly hope that you talk about your alcohol drinking with both of them.

I don't want to be a dick here, but here's a friendly reminder that alcohol can actually kill you.  I grew up across the street from a family that was destroyed by alcoholism.  The parents got divorced, and then the son became an alcoholic and committed suicide, and shortly afterwards the father drank himself to death.  One family - totally destroyed by alcohol.  Fuuuuuuu.  Sad, sad, sad.

I hope that you talk to both your psychologist and psychiatrist about your drinking and weed use.  At a minimum, you owe it to the psychiatrist to know these things so that he has a decent chance of prescribing the right medication to you.  

Well, whether  you decide to talk about your sex addiction to the therapist you already know well, or talk about it in a group of mostly strangers, it sounds to me like you're getting to be OK with talking about it.  I can certainly tell that you have some concerns about being thought of as a weirdo (or some kind of monster, I can't tell which), but taking the risk of talking about it in a therapeutic environment seems like a your odds of getting a negative response are low.  I certainly hope that your kinks are only related to adults and not to minors 'cause well.... I have another story about a former neighbor who destroyed his life because he was a pedophile.  Well, whatever the specific kinks you're into, it's better to get some help and get it off your chest around people you can trust and can expect to react in a mature, helpful way about things.

I hope that instead of letting your mind run off with self-criticism, that you'll be able to interrupt your thoughts or at least count the number of times you have self-critical thoughts.  Simply recognizing the thought as they happen (I know this is somewhat difficult because you can't both think a thought and be aware of the thought at the same time) or just immediately after they happen is a good practice to get into.  And when you start to notice that your mind becomes an endless spring of self-criticism, you can start to tell yourself, ""here we go again, I should really try to think of something more positive"" or ""oh, these negative thoughts are so tedious and depressing, they're so non-constructive and harmful.  It would be nice if I could think of almost anything else.""  Just simply recognizing your self-critical thoughts as they happen (or shortly thereafter) - as opposed to getting lost in them - will be so much better for you.  I know you have it in you to change your thinking and to separate your thoughts from yourself and to objectify your thoughts as separate from yourself.  That way, hopefully, you won't feel so depressed and brought down by all these self-critical thoughts and you won't feel the need to drink or smoke weed to the point of blacking out.

I'm sure you know that drugging until you black out is not going to work out for you in the long run.  No need to lecture there.  I hate to see you in pain like this and I hope you can find ways to interrupt whatever train of negative or self-critical thoughts may be brewing.  

As for your ""failings"" think about this - the history of philosophy is littered with failures and failed thinking.  Even the most brilliant people fail - and repeatedly too.  The important thing (you know what I'm going to say, I know you do) is that you keep trying.  Give yourself some credit and make note of the progress you've made.  Perhaps you should think about the myth of Sisyphus.  The Greek story of the man who was doomed to roll a rock uphill for all eternity.  So what if you never get to this (overly-)romanticized goal of perfection?  The most amazing thing about you is you have the strength to keep picking yourself up and dusting yourself off over and over again.  That's what makes you strong.

Anyway, I'm sorry if I've been sounding preachy, I don't mean to be a dickhole.  I know that in my personal life I have to deal with my unipolar depression - which is its own trial.  So I hope you don't think I'm talking down to you.  We all have our own stones to roll uphill.  I hope you'll consider some of my suggestions.  And more importantly, I hope you have continued success and continued will to fight the good fight.  Good luck!!"

t3_bkxua,AskReddit,2,0, train ,"**CONTINUED FROM MAIN POST**

Two days later, on Saturday morning, I arose, a tottering wreck, and went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend, the Rev. Mr.------, to walk to the Talcott Tower, ten miles distant. He stared at me, but asked no questions. We started. Mr.------ talked, talked, talked as is his wont. I said nothing; I heard nothing. At the end of a mile, Mr.------ said ""Mark, are you sick? I never saw a man look so haggard and worn and absent-minded. Say something, do!""

Drearily, without enthusiasm, I said: ""Punch brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!""

My friend eyed me blankly, looked perplexed, they said:

""I do not think I get your drift, Mark. Then does not seem to be any relevancy in what you have said, certainly nothing sad; and yet--maybe it was the way you said the words--I never heard anything that sounded so pathetic. What is--""

But I heard no more. I was already far away with my pitiless, heartbreaking ""blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, pink trip slip for a three-cent fare; punch in the presence of the passenjare."" I do not know what occurred during the other nine miles. However, all of a sudden Mr.------ laid his hand on my shoulder and shouted:

""Oh, wake up! wake up! wake up! Don't sleep all day! Here we are at the Tower, man! I have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind, and never got a response. Just look at this magnificent autumn landscape! Look at it! look at it! Feast your eye on it! You have traveled; you have seen boaster landscapes elsewhere. Come, now, deliver an honest opinion. What do you say to this?""

I sighed wearily; and murmured:

""A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare, punch in the presence of the passenjare.""

Rev. Mr. ------ stood there, very grave, full of concern, apparently, and looked long at me; then he said:

""Mark, there is something about this that I cannot understand. Those are about the same words you said before; there does not seem to be anything in them, and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them. Punch in the--how is it they go?""

I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines.

My friend's face lighted with interest. He said:

""Why, what a captivating jingle it is! It is almost music. It flows along so nicely. I have nearly caught the rhymes myself. Say them over just once more, and then I'll have them, sure.""

I said them over. Then Mr. ------ said them. He made one little mistake, which I corrected. The next time and the next he got them right. Now a great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders. That torturing jingle departed out of my brain, and a grateful sense of rest and peace descended upon me. I was light-hearted enough to sing; and I did sing for half an hour, straight along, as we went jogging homeward. Then my freed tongue found blessed speech again, and the pent talk of many a weary hour began to gush and flow. It flowed on and on, joyously, jubilantly, until the fountain was empty and dry. As I wrung my friend's hand at parting, I said:

""Haven't we had a royal good time! But now I remember, you haven't said a word for two hours. Come, come, out with something!""

The Rev. Mr.------ turned a lack-luster eye upon me, drew a deep sigh, and said, without animation, without apparent consciousness:

""Punch, brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!"" 

A pang shot through me as I said to myself, ""Poor fellow, poor fellow! he has got it, now.""

I did not see Mr.------ for two or three days after that. Then, on Tuesday evening, he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into a seat. He was pale, worn; he was a wreck. He lifted his faded eyes to my face and said:

""Ah, Mark, it was a ruinous investment that I made in those heartless rhymes. They have ridden me like a nightmare, day and night, hour after hour, to this very moment. Since I saw you I have suffered the torments of the lost. Saturday evening I had a sudden call, by telegraph, and took the night train for Boston. The occasion was the death of a valued old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon. I took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse. But I never got beyond the opening paragraph; for then the train started and the car-wheels began their 'clack, clack-clack-clack-clack! clack-clack! --clack-clack-clack!' and right away those odious rhymes fitted themselves to that accompaniment. For an hour I sat there and set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the car-wheels made. Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had been chopping wood all day. My skull was splitting with headache. It seemed to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and went to bed. I stretched myself out in my berth, and--well, you know what the result was. The thing went right along, just the same. 'Clack-clack clack, a blue trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight cent fare; clack-clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack clack-clack, for a six-cent fare, and so on, and so on, and so on punch in the presence of the passenjare!' Sleep? Not a single wink! I was almost a lunatic when I got to Boston. Don't ask me about the funeral. I did the best I could, but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and out with 'Punch, brothers, punch with care, punch in the presence of the passenjare.' And the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes, and I could actually catch absent-minded people nodding time to the swing of it with their stupid heads. And, Mark, you may believe it or not, but before I got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in solemn unison, mourners, undertaker, and all. The moment I had finished, I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy. Of course it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the deceased there, who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into the church. She began to sob, and said:

""'Oh, oh, he is gone, he is gone, and I didn't see him before he died!'

""'Yes!' I said, 'he is gone, he is gone, he is gone--oh, will this suffering never cease!'

""'You loved him, then! Oh, you too loved him!'

""'Loved him! Loved who?'

""'Why, my poor George! my poor nephew!'

""'Oh--him! Yes--oh, yes, yes. Certainly--certainly. Punch--punch--oh, this misery will kill me!'

""'Bless you! bless you, sir, for these sweet words! I, too, suffer in this dear loss. Were you present during his last moments?'

""'Yes. I--whose last moments?'

""'His. The dear departed's.'

""'Yes! Oh, yes--yes--yes! I suppose so, I think so, I don't know! Oh, certainly--I was there I was there!'

""'Oh, what a privilege! what a precious privilege! And his last words --oh, tell me, tell me his last words! What did he say?'

t3_bkvsk,Libertarian,4,0, transportation ,"&gt; If every student is going to pay for it, surely many students will decide that they might as well save the money for gasoline and parking fees and take public transportation instead in order to save a bit of cash. It's ""free"" so far as they can see it, so why not use it? The reality is that it's not free - people pay for it. 

I think you're confusing two ideas here. If your university is anything like the ones I know, there's a large parking shortage. A market system could take care of that, but it would be unpalatable. So, they must look for other methods of solving the problem. One could be subsidizing public transportation. There's no marginal cost with each ride, so I am pretty sure usage would go up, and that would help with the parking situation.

I'm not really sure what you're getting at, because I'm not sure what you're calling socialized, what you're calling bad, and what you're calling good. If it was a %100 private funded university, using %100 private roads, would it still be socialism to take the %100 voluntarily obtained money/resources, and somehow direct how people get around campus?"

A few years ago I went balls to the wall and dieted. Starting at 111kg I was running about 10k, lifting, and eating less than 2000 calories daily. I ate all bran, fruits, veggies, chicken, and fish. I drank only water and sometimes juice mixed with water. I dropped close to 20kg in 4 months. After that I was stuck at 90kg. I tried everything. Even double 10k sessions and eating even less. Nothing changed. I eventually started eating regularly but continued to exercise and I went to up to 98kg. I decided to see what would happen if I stopped working out and ate like a regular person and for about 4 months I had no weight gain but it suddenly packed on weight in a matter of weeks (maybe 3 weeks) and jumped back up to 111 because I couldn't train due to an injury. It was like the flood gates were opened. I don't drink soda, eat junk food, or anything like that.

I'm snowboarding in Salt Lake City (well nearby) and login to ... (this shows how old I am) compuserve (it was *the* way to get onto the internet when you were travelling - all ""local"" calls) and I email a few friends who I know at work. One of them lets me know that Mikey lives nearby (with his new missus) so I catch up with him. I don't remember much of the evening apart from the beginning (where I'm demoing my new video camera purchased for cheap yankee dollars) and how we said ""yep the next time we use this we'll both be drunk and dancing naked"", the part where we tried to crash Debbie Harry's gig and then the next morning where I reviewed said tape and yes there we were.. dancing and (er) naked - an old Plymouth tradition. Ok - not much small worldness there but it gets weirder.

Fast forward a few more years. Visiting NYC on a business trip. Standing on Wall Street station platform and how do I bump into ? After not seeing since SLC ? Yep MIKEY! Rinse repeat above shenanigans (but no video recorder).

Few more years later, in NYC again, coming out of Wall Street Station to visit a mate who works nearby, remembering about Mikey on the platform. No where to be scene this day.

t3_bl1un,AskReddit,1,0, train ,"Well, it's the Netherlands, first thing a local would do is to check the weather (http://knmi.nl/index_en.html).

If it's dark and rainy, go by foot in the old city centres and check out the museums and fine restaurants.

If it's windy with some rain, go to the coast cities (The Hague and around) and combine the inner city visits with a walk through the dunes. Take an extra rain coat or some good clothing, the sea wind may almost blow you off your feet, but it's refreshing and entertaining.

If it's nicer weather, some sun and less windy, and you're in good condition, you should rent bikes or bring yours, and choose a bed &amp; breakfast in some pittoresque village in the 'green heart' (in between Utrecht, Amsterdam and Rotterdam) or north from Amsterdam. Use that as your base station and ride your bike to sneak into the cities. You can even rent recumbent bikes ('ligfiets verhuur') if you want to ride longer distances easily, but they're not as cheap and easy to find as a normal railway station rent bike. [Addit] Oh, and lock your bike well (attached to a rack, fence or pole), when you leave it in the cities...

The nicest tracks that take you into the cities without having to navigate the suburbs and industrial zones are usually the ones that go along some river or canal. Check out the map first, and look for those old, small and winding rivers that break the typical square patterns of the Dutch polder landscape. Like the Vecht, Amstel, Kromme Mijdrecht, Oude Rijn, Vlist, Rotte. Or, when you're north of Amsterdam, a 'ringvaart' around a polder.

When going by car, the first thing a local would do is to check for traffic congestion (http://www.trafficnet.nl). Going by car into the cities will burn your time, and parking mid-centre will cost you lots of money if you don't know your ways like the locals do. Train and trams are faster, but can be crowded and stressfull too at times. You can still buy the old and cheap 'strippenkaart' for the tram, but they're converting to electronic chip cards, which may be a bit confusing how to check in and out when train and tram travel is combined. Around the railway station of Amsterdam there's a lot of building work too these years.

t3_bkv0t,australia,1,0, train ,"I would do Sydney.  It has all the icons and the scenic views, and it's beautiful.  And for about $5 take the ferry from Circular Quay (where the Opera House and Harbour bridge are) to Manly beach.  Cheaper and more beautiful than any harbour cruise, you'll get fantastic photos and video.  If time is short, don't bother with Bondi, the name is more iconic than the actual beach.  Manly is way more beautiful.

Melbourne has a lot to offer, but it's not a particularly pretty city and you won't get your tourist-shots in.  Plus it is a little harder to dig under the surface to get the good stuff if you're just there on a fly-by visit.

If you are in Cairns for enough time, take the cable car to Kuranda (the mountain train is a bit shit and cramped, IMO, but you could take it one way.  My advice is to take the cable car both ways).

If you go to the reef, go to the *outer* reef.  This is really important.  The coral on the inner reef can sadly be all bleached out and very disappointing.  Outer reef trips cost a bit more but are worth it.

Given it's July - which is ""winter"" down south, you might want to consider doing something a bit different and staying north.  I would highly recommend going to Darwin - which will be hot and dry in July - and visiting the national parks there.  Kakadu is great for wildlife but you can't swim (crocs), Litchfield is sensational for its rock pools and swimming holes.  If you only have time for one do Litchfield.

In Darwin you'll also get a much more ""local culture"" experience - there are tonnes of Aboriginal people around, many of whom are very friendly and interesting to talk with about their history and culture.  Plus there are real ""ocker"" outback-type non-indigenous Australians up there, think Crocodile Dundee.

Also in the Darwin museum (free entry) there's a display about Cyclone Tracy, including an audio recording of it.  It will haunt me for the rest of my life as one of the creepiest and most terrifying, unearthly sounds I have ever experienced.  It sounds like you imagine hell might sound.

I went to one of my best friend's birthday parties in NYC and met a friend of her's who I've heard much about but never met up until then. It was a very small group of 5 people and my best friend and two others were talking over dinner about things I hadn't been to (I've spent alot of time away from NY with school, etc) so I couldn't be involved in the conversation. The guy, had served in the military for the past few years so also could not contribute to their convo. He and I ended up talking and hitting it off, so we exchanged numbers. Later that night on our way back to my best friend's house, we were in the subway and I was a little drunk. My friend had noticed he was texting me and then started going through every single one of my past relationships telling me exactly what I did wrong and what my problems were. Needless to say, I was really hurt by this because previously she'd explained she only had a crush on him back in elementary school (she's in her late 20's now). But when we got back to her house, she said she didn't care if we hung out or whatever so I thought things were ok. But when I woke up, she said she had changed her mind and it wasn't ok for us to hang out. Things just got really awkward from there.

Long story short, he and I liked each other and ended up hanging out and eventually sleeping together. Shortly after he went off to London for grad school and things did fizzle out. It was fun while it lasted. My friend, on the other hand, hasn't spoken to me since then, save a few exchanged emails. If there was more than just a crush she could have explained that to me, but I didn't see the big deal. If they had dated I would have stayed away but IMO I didn't do anything wrong. I tried many many times to get in touch with her to talk things out but to no avail. If she really valued our friendship she would talk to me and work it out. But I guess it's just one of those moments when you realize who really is your friend... 

As with your situation, it's possible that she may never forgive you, especially if she's obsessed over him. Just take space for awhile, don't badger her into talking to you or forgiving you etc. Do your own thing and if she really values your friendship, I believe she will come around."

When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only gave his famous ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" statement but followed it by several remarks, usual com traffic between him, the other astronauts and Mission Control. Just before he re-entered the lander, however, he made the enigmatic remark ""Good luck, Mr. Gorsky.""

Many people at NASA thought it was a casual remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut. However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs. Over the years many people questioned Armstrong as to what the ""Good luck, Mr. Gorsky"" statement meant, but Armstrong always just smiled.

On July 5, 1995 (in Tampa Bay, FL) while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26-year-old question to Armstrong. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question.

When he was a kid, he was playing baseball with a friend in the backyard. His friend hit a fly ball which landed in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows. His neighbors were Mr. &amp; Mrs. Gorsky.

As he leaned down to pick up the ball, young Armstrong heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, ""Oral sex! You want oral sex?! You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!""

t3_bknme,programming,1,0, bus ,"Yes GPU's have cache.  In fact they have a variety of different caches.  The type that is similar to CPU cache is often much smaller than what you'd find on a CPU though.  The difference with your traditional GPU caching vs. CPU caching is that on the CPU it's pretty much hidden from the programmer.  On the other hand, when writing GPU code you have to (assuming you want good performance) manually pull in chuncks of memory into shared local memory, have a group of threads process it, then push it back out to GPU memory.  GPU cache's are share between threads that run on the same core, but not shared between all threads.  Your end results do need to end up in GPU memory so at the end of your Kernel it will be pushed back out.

It's more correct to say ""Moving data from main memory to the GPU memory _can be_ a bottleneck"".  This certainly isn't always the case, it depends on the problem.  If the amount of input data is large, and the amount of work on that data is small, then the cost of moving that data around will proportionally be large.  The transfer is ultimately limited by the bandwidth of the PCIe bus rather than either memory bandwidth.  I don't know for sure, but I think multiple graphics cards would share the  same PCIe bus, so I don't think that would help much.  If you're not bottlenecked by the transfer then mutlple cards can speed up the computation however.

Another point is that even if your input data is small, it may not be worth doing on the GPU.  Audio mixing is a good example.  It could easily be done on the GPU, but it's likely not computationally expensive enough to overcome the overhead of doing it on the GPU instead of the CPU (if we're just talking about simple mixing).

You can think of a GPU as being like a train.  It takes a while to get going, but once it does it's powerfull and efficient.  If you have a big load, and need to go a long distance, then you can't beat a train.  A CPU is more like a car.  It's convienent and versitile.  You can just hop in a car anytime you want and go just about anywhere.  You can't carry too big of a load and it only gets 25mpg but a car is still the prefered way for most people to move around."

t3_bk8ef,AskReddit,1,0, train ,"Hmm, i feel there is a misunderstanding here.  First off horses and dogs have nothing to do with each other.  So, yes, it is not correct to use them to learn about dogs.  All dogs lines however, are descendents of wolves, so logically it makes sense to look at wolves for learning about how situations are handled in the wild, so in that respect it is fair to look at wolves, all the while not generalizing Dogs since there are breed differences and personality differences.  In fact in the article you linked he talks about ways to train a dog and even mentions this: ""The research by David Mech showed wolves train their young pups using this technique.""

I read the article, here is the misunderstanding, the term ""alpha"" may be incorrectly used in modern society but the idea is essentially the same as what your magazine is talking about.  For example  

&gt;The leadership model requires the leader to be in control of all the desirable resources.
For our dogs this is food, quality attention such as praise or petting, water, preferred rest sites, the things necessary for the care of the dog. The dog wants these resources and is willing to work for them. The leader-follower relationship therefore parallels a care-dependency type of relationship.  When the dog does the desired task it gets paid by receiving some of the desired resources. The dog is working for a living, but because he is getting paid with something positive, he is willing to repeat the desired task. When the dog does something undesirable or refuses to do the desirable thing, the pay is withheld. Gradually the dog does only the correct thing because it pays off and the undesirable drops out because there is no pay-off.  

This is exactly what Cesar teaches (and most trainers for that matter).  When i talk about dominance or alpha i don't mean beating the dog and even hitting the dog.  In fact it seems most of what this guy is writing about is what people think of when they talk about being ""alpha"", by that they mean being leader, which is what this guy is promoting.  So i feel its more of a miscommunication of words than a completely different style of viewing a human/dog relationship.  It seems like he isn't really writing anything new or anything i haven't read in a dog obedience or training book before but he is just switching the terms we use. 

While i agree with most of what he says and in fact employ most of his tips with my dog i did find his article to be a little arrogant and also unscientific, he writes like we should take his opinion at face value with little or no evidence to back it up, but thats just me ranting about the article. =)

t3_bl0lg,climateskeptics,8,0, urban ,"Such an incredible amount of anti-science it's difficult to respond to it all.

Just a few picked at random:

&gt;And since 1998, it's just cooling. Cook has no counter-arguments.

This is simply a lie, nothing less. [Several statisticians were given data blindly](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/26/tech/main5423035.shtml) and asked to find a trend; all found an upward trend. It was temperature data.

And is he reading the same SkepticalScience article? [The article in question](http://skepticalscience.com/global-cooling.htm) says that the atmosphere and land are only one small part of the climate system; the oceans are the largest, and much of the time the accumulating heat goes into them instead of the atmosphere. 

Trenberth's ""travesty"" is that we don't have a good enough accounting system to precisely track *where* the heat is going at any particular moment.

&gt;all IPCC-endorsed models predicted a warming since 1998 that didn't occur.

Climate models are designed to examine *climate*. That is, weather averaged over typically 30 years. They won't be able to pick up the chaotic noise of weather over shorter periods. Think of weighted dice: you won't be able to predict each roll, but you *will* be able to predict that 7 will come up more often than any other number.

So Motl's criticism here betrays a misunderstanding of basic climate science.

&gt;Well, they're surely not negligible because the estimated urban warming in typical large cities exceeds the whole assumed warming caused by CO2 - something like 0.6 ¬∞C.

OK, so in the article SkepticalScience links to multiple studies that found the UHI effect to be neglible. But Lubos Motl says, without a shred of supporting evidence, no. ??? Argument by assertion, I guess?

&gt;The number of recently found dramatic problems with the surface record is so huge that I can't even enumerate them here.

What is he talking about? [Menne 2010](http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ushcn/v2/monthly/menne-etal2010.pdf) just did a study on the surface record, using much of Anthony Watts' data. They did indeed find a bias in the record: a cooling one. So here he is just using argument by assertion again. Just say something, and it's true!

&gt;Cook claims that the Earth continued to accumulate heat. If you check his evidence, you will see that it is a circular reasoning because the sources also use the models in which the warming should have continued.

Huh?! The studies cited aren't even using models! Did Motl even *read* the flippin' article at all?!

&gt;Cook claims that these predictions were largely media-based. Well, the same is true about the current global warming alarm.

Another lie. The current global warming alarm comes from science. Check the references in at the end of each chapter of AR4. Another argument by assertion. I need to try this: I have $1 million. .....nope, doesn't work. Failure in reasoning.

&gt;Cook claims that CO2 beats all other things. At some point in the future, this statement will of course become ridiculous.

CO2 beats everything else right now and for the forseeable future, but not forever. Motl says another Ice Age will return in 10,000 years. Great. And irrelevant. Red herring fallacy.

&gt;He correctly says that a few extreme local weather episodes aren't enough to calculate the global or long-term trend. However, it's exactly the alarmist movement - and the likes of Al Gore - who would be making this error all the time.

Respond to an accusation by turning the accusation back on the accuser? The argument in question is about how skeptic's use local weather phenomenon to cast doubt on global warming, not about alarmist use of same. Logical fallacy committed is Tu Quoque. And besides, it's the media that makes this argument, not the science.

&gt;but serious science has definitely rejected the hockey stick as the shape of the reconstructions.

I'd love to see this ""serious science."" I bet it's an opinion column on a conservative blogger account somewhere.

&gt;The added statement about the CO2 driving the changes since 1970 is unsupported. 

Is he serious?! There are tons of studies that attribute warming since 1970 to CO2. Much of them *directly* and *empirically* measuring the radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere.

&gt;Moreover, note that the greenhouse emissions didn't start in 1970. They were almost the same in the 1960s, too. But because there was no warming in that decade, Cook tries to hide those emissions.

I seriously doubt Motl even read these articles. From the article in question: ""Sulfate aerosols have a cooling effect, growing stronger after around 1950.""

And that's all I have time for. This article cannot possibly be serious. My theory is that Motl is a deep cover alarmist trying to make the skeptics look bad from the inside. "

[I just proved that you are lying, that with a perpendicular force, there is no acceleration and there is no energy.](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/wcon.html) You refuse to either examine evidence contrary to your own beliefs or think using common sense.

&gt; Your example of mass restricted to a path is ridiculous.

[*It is not my example*, it is the content of present physical theory.](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/wcon.html) Your argument applies with equal stupidity to linear and rotational motion.

Your objection is equivalent to saying, ""What do all those physicists know, anyway?"" All this apart from your inability to apply common sense to the problem.

&gt; If you restrict it and don't provide enough force to overpower that restriction then of course it isn't going to move it. However, it is still being accelerated and energy is still being expended.

So a railroad train moving in a straight line down a track needs to constantly expend additional energy to overcome the forces that prevent it moving sideways? So an ideal piston moving through a cylinder needs to constantly provide additional energy to keep its rings compressed against the cylinder walls? So a bolt, tightly secured against a surface, must constantly provide energy to maintain the static force and stay in place? So a mechanical alarm clock, once fully wound but not running, must expend energy to maintain the spring's static-force tension?

&gt; You should look up Newton's other laws of motion.

No, that's what you should do. I just provided a flat and conclusive falsification of your viewpoint using literature resources readable and comprehensible by anyone above a very low I.Q.. I just provided additional common-sense examples from everyday life to the same end, with equal futility.

You are a hopeless, ignorant True Believer in his own church of one.

In electronics, the presence of a voltage (a static force) and no current *does not mean* that electrons are being accelerated or that energy is being expended to maintain the static force. In gas physics, the existence of a pressurized vessel *does not mean* that gas molecules are being accelerated or energy is being expended to maintain the static-force pressure. In a rotating flywheel, the presence of a perpendicular static centripetal force *does not mean* that acceleration is present nor that energy is required, which is why in the absence of friction the flywheel will continue to rotate at the same speed indefinitely.

For a flywheel, your claim that energy is being expended is obviously false -- if it were true, the flywheel would have to give up some of its momentum to obey energy conservation (it would have to slow down and eventually stop). This is the most basic kind of physics, and if this were a physics discussion, you would instantly see the error in your thinking.

Acceleration is the first derivative of velocity. If the velocity is a constant, the acceleration is zero. For a linear motion, *with no forces aligned with the direction of motion*, linear velocity is constant, so there is no acceleration and no energy expenditure, *regardless of how much perpendicular force is present*. In the same way, for a rotational motion, *with no forces aligned with the direction of motion*, angular velocity is a constant, so there is no acceleration and no energy expenditure, *regardless of how much perpendicular force is present*.

&gt; I'm not wrong, so yes, anything but that.

In the realm of crackpot jackasses who can't be bothered to test their own ideas, yes, of course you are right. How could it be otherwise?

[Zero Work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_energy_theorem#Zero_work) : ""Work can be zero even when there is a force. The centripetal force in a uniform circular motion, for example, does zero work since the kinetic energy of the moving object doesn't change. *This is because the force is always perpendicular to the motion of the object; only the component of a force parallel to the velocity vector of an object can do work on that object.*"" (emphasis added)

We are done. You just proved that this is not a physics discussion at all. You just exposed yourself as a crackpot with no interest in physics or science.

I think that there *are* legitimate concerns that go along with the burqa and the niqab, but that wide scale bans are often attempts the resolve those concerns with a sledgehammer rather than the scalpel they deserve.  And in part, that's because a lot of the opposition to those kinds of attire seems to be motivated not by those legitimate concerns, but rather by xenophobia.

What's a legitimate concern?  Sometimes it's necessary for legal reasons to be able to identify a person, and to the extent that a burqa stands in the way of that, it's a civil concern.  Some countries have dealt with that concern by, for example, having female security officers who can verify the identity of women wearing burqas in a controlled environment.

Yeah, that places a small additional burden on government institutions, but that's the price of pluralism.  If Belgium isn't comfortable with pluralism, I suggest it close down its borders (my passport wasn't even checked riding the train in from Amsterdam) and ask the EU to relocate its headquarters to somewhere with an appropriately open policy.

What's not a reasonable concern is the idea that the burqa and niqab are somehow tools in an Islamic takeover of Europe.  It's no more reasonable to suppose that a person wearing a burka is strapped with plastique that it would be to suppose that everyone wearing a Gortex jacket is going to detonate themselves in your local cafe.  I'd say the Gortex jacket is a better bet, actually, since suicide bombers are surely aware that any outside emblem marking them as devout Muslims are sure to arouse suspicions in the Islamiphobic climate that pervades much of Europe these days.

The real world is a different, finite, and unforgiving place. It doesn't give a shit about contractual guarantees of X% YOY returns.  In the REAL physical world a ""profit"" means you must gain MORE return on your work than the energy and resources you put into the equation; for every grain of wheat you plant, you must harvest a hundred-fold (and more).

Actual physical *work* must be done and resources must be available and used up in order to mine metals, plant and harvest crops for food and forests for wood. And then to move them to where they can be refined and processed and eventually packaged for the massive urban market.  It is not simply a matter of whether energy costs get ""higher"" (although that certainly affects costs and final prices) -- it is a matter of whether the current system (or anything like it) can even continue to operate as resources diminish. We cannot simply ""backtrack"" thru the previous technologies and methods because those made *less* efficient use of energy (and the energy sources used were less ""dense"" and therefore more difficult to transport) -- they were *less* productive (meaning shortages with the current much higher demand), and even if they weren't, the resources they depended upon have also continued to be consumed and are likewise being used up or used for other purposes. In short, we have a highly optimized and efficient system that is very dependent upon the maintenance of extremely long specific supply chains -- any major ""disruption"" in those supply chains will force a pullback and a reverse downward spiral (which are always much more rapid than the upward ones).

And this is such a complex and widespread issue, that there is really no way to ""calculate"" a tax on each person that would be ""fair"" (i.e. only paying for government services that they utilize).


&gt;What I mean is, suppose the government budge grows and grows, and the progressive tax system increases to keep up with the budget.


Well that's a bit of a slippery slope argument.  I don't think that should happen, (and neither do most liberals).  It would be very **un**fair for wealthy individuals to pay a 94% tax rate (like they did at the end of WWII).


Believe it or not, most of us liberals actually believe in capitalism, just a more regulated form of it than conservatives.  Everyone making the same income regardless of occupation would not be a tenable system in our current society.  A progressive tax does not necessarily mean a gradual slide into socialism.


&gt;I believe it's important to reward innovation and hard work.

So do I.


&gt;resenting those with higher incomes

I don't resent people with higher incomes.  (In fact, I do have a fairly high income myself).  I just think that it's not necessarily unfair to require a little more contribution from people that have more to give.  Especially when many of those people were able to get where they are *because* of the system/society we have all contributed to.


&gt;I'd like to see a lot more resentment directed at the government for growing like a parasite and spending all of our money.


I'd like to see less resentment and more calm and reasoned debate/discussion.


I also don't have a problem with the government spending our money.  I have a problem with them spending it *unwisely* or simply *wasting* it.  Government spending gets us some great things; roads, clean food/water/air, a justice system, an education system, the Internet you're using now to read reddit.  We can **all** be against government waste.  But that doesn't make me against government spending *in general*."

Sidechain compression is not that new of technique believe it or not...it's just been done to death now.

There's a lot of different opinions on this, but I like to use this technique as tastefully as possible, and not over do it.

By far, the most common thing you'll hear is the white noise build sidechained to the kick.  What is really going on is tricky volume automation, that is, when the kick signal triggers, the volume of the instrument listening to the kick will ""duck"" or reduce in volume, thus creating that ""pumping"" effect.  A lot of compressors will have a sidechain feature that you can switch on...you just have to tell it what bus to listen to, i.e., the the bus your kick is on.

Another technique is simply to create a new channel with any instrument, type in a 4x4 midi pattern (or you can use the actual audio/wav file) and then turn off that channels output.  The benefit here is, if you decide to remove the kick in a section of your song, you can continue the pumping effect without any audible signal from the kick.

Bass instruments are commonly side chained to the kick in order to balance the mix.  The kick is usually the strongest element in a dance music track, and things can get muddy in the low end when you have your bass instruments and the kick hitting at the same time.  Subtle sidechain compression can ensure that the kick still cuts through the mix with many elements playing at once.

You can do more than just the standard 4x4 pumping effect; using the dummy signal technique i explained above, try painting in different rhythms and sidechain a pad instrument...you can achieve some cool gating effects this way.

You will need to understand the nature of a compressor if you want to tweak the amount of pumping.  The attack and release settings will control how fast the volume dips down to the assigned ""threshold"" and returns to the it's original volume output.  Usually you will assign a very low threshold, little to no gain boost, and very fast attack settings for an extreme pumping sound.

So there you have it...if you're still scratching your head, there are a ton of tutorials online for the actual ""how to"" sidechain instruments.  This was just a very broad overview for common uses.

When I made this comic this morning I didn't think I would care, given that I never had a relationship with him and always was kind of angry that he missed out on my life.  But I'm the type of person who believes that people deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, even if they made mistakes.  I've always been in favor of programs that try to rehabilitate inmates instead of just keep that door revolving, and I think its important to give people a second change when they get out.  But with my father I always harbored this resentment for him being locked up, and not doing his job being my dad.  Now I feel like I should have visited him and at least helped him feel good about himself, knowing that he has a son on the outside that's doing great. 

I am not greiving in the sense that I lost a loved one, and know I'll never see him again.  He was not a loved one.  The way I feel right now is like if you walk to the bus stop every day, and there's some bum there who smells bad and he always asks for change, and you tell him to fuck off and get a job, well one day he's not there, and you find out he froze to death over the winter.

**Edit:** [Here it is by NikkiA:](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/b6btl/steam_appears_to_have_become_sentient_and_knows/c0l6f10)

No, I don't buy all of it. I have zero interest in non-british railway stuff for a start, and I simply can't afford all of the DLC.

What sets it apart? Well, there are only really 3 railway/train simulation products at present, the 10 year old MSTS, Trainz (in its various versions, latest being 2010:EE), and RailWorks (a continuation of RailSimulator, which was in turn a sequel to MSTS published by EA).

MSTS is old, it has a metric fuckload of downloadable content - trains, routes, etc, but it shows its age whenever you use it, it runs fullscreen, only supports up to 1280x1024. The graphics were dated even in 2001, and look like pre-3dfx era graphics today. It doesn't have any physics simulation, so things like collisions are basic bounding-box detections.

Trainz is a bit more advanced, it's graphics have been updated since the 2001 initial release, although they're not 'cutting edge' by gaming industry standards. It has moderate physics simulation, although until recently only when in cab view mode. The basic game is a very limited set of trains and routes, with user-created-content numbering around 100,000 assets on the DLS (DownLoad Station). Most content is free, with some non-DLS payware content.

RailSimulator was developed by Kuju, who developed MSTS, and it's primary selling points were 'modern graphics' and 'PhysX based physics'. Of course EA really had no idea what they were doing with the simulation market, and so the product was essentially dead-on-arrival as far as they were concerned. User-generated content existed, and one of the payware content producers convinced the holders of RailSimulator's copyrights (Fund4Games) to let them take over the source code.

Which produced RailWorks, a (slight) upgrade on RailSimulator, with some bug fixes, and added routes and trains. As every steam users knows, it sees frequent DLC releases, however, there is also a moderate (and growing, the game's only been out less than a year) amount of freeware and payware user-generated content, plus it is mostly compatible with RailSimulator content.

Railworks and Trainz thus are the 2 main contenders for modern-feature rail simulation at the present time, with each having pros and cons - railworks has automatic dispatching that allows you to setup driving rules that let you focus on the actual train driving, and operation of shunting, etc. Trainz has more content, and far more of it is free, but lacks a dispatcher, and every driving session will involve LOTS of switch and signal setting to get where you want to go. Trainz's graphics are also a few years behind Railworks in terms of visual style, trainz has that stereotypical 'gouraud shaded' OpenGL look.

The DLC everyone sees on Steam is a bit misleading, yes, there's a lot of it, and yes, it gets hideously expensive if you were to buy all of it, and the Steam DLC is only a fraction of the payware add-ons for Railworks.

However, by the same token, people don't generally criticise Microsoft Flight Simulator, yet if you were to add up all of the payware addons for MSFS you'd be looking at several hundred thousand dollars worth, just take a quick look at one of the vendors of FS addons, and you'll see what I mean (http://www.justflight.com/).

Basically, if Microsoft sold the next version of Flight Simulator via Steam, you'd see the same situation, only 10 times worse.

And just like flight simulator, there is plenty of freeware content to use for Railworks - not as much as there is for trainz, but that's life - if you don't wish to be nickel and dimed to death :)

Edit to add:

For reference, I stated those are the 3 primary simulators, there are other, lesser, simulators that don't see anywhere near as much action, and there is a project to build an open-source simulator, that currently works with content made for MSTS. MSTS was also recently given a 'binary patch' by a 3rd party who reverse engineered parts of the program and improved some of the graphical abilities, it's still a nearly 10 year old program though.

And yes, I own all 3 of the major sims, so I get to choose which I want to use for what. RailWorks is the best in terms of graphics and physics, although it is still buggy in places and will need work, whether the group that now is developing it can do such to Kuju's codebase, I don't know, time will tell.

No, it is NOT just a ""negative economic factor"" (there you go again with the blinders on and the ""academic/numbers"" view).

What is important is that the more expensive oil -- despite fully optimized, highly efficient drilling, transporting and refining operations -- is a SIGN of something. The market is trying to TELL you something, and that something is that the supply is running out relative to the current and projected future demand.

And THAT means our entire world is going to be changing pretty darn dramatically -- from bottom to top.

But to YOU all it means is whether you should invest in this ETF ...or maybe *that* one. (Because hell, someone *else* will deal with whatever the other problems that result from that are -- as long as you have enough ""digits"" in your account, you figure you'll do OK -- and if not, you can be part of the mob that demands the government DO SOMETHING about it to give you handouts or bailouts or some other form of support {because you naively think that the government actually gives a shit about you}.)

&gt;It puzzles me, from a psychology standpoint, that so many people have tendency to fixate on apocalypse scenarios. Religions and cults have them, and the internet is full of them. But I digress.

Conversely what puzzles ME is the naivete and utterly ignorant ""faith"" that everyone has for the future based solely upon the past few decades.

What puzzles me is the Pollyanna belief that progress is linear, guaranteed and somehow ""automatic"" -- that it will just ""happen"" to work out -- and that anyone DOING risk analysis and identifying the ""game-ending scenarios"" is somehow exhibiting a psychological aberration (they're such ""emotional downers""... I mean that's such a drag... party on Garth!)

Risk analysis, identifying future potential ""big problems"" and contemplating scenarios for *solving* those problems are NOT the same as ""apocalyptic"" thinking.  

The engineer who analyzes HOW a bridge would fail is a far better engineer than the idiot who simply dismisses those things and believes that he can simply ""scale up"" a previous bridge design -- and likewise the architect who thinks a 200 story building can be designed in the same manner as a 5 story building by just ""adding a bunch more floors"" -- is an idiot.

Yet THAT is the level of idiot ""thinking"" and so-called ""analysis"" that takes place in most financial, economic, and political circles -- and the prevalence of that mindset is why we continuously undergo the cyclical business &amp; finance catastrophes -- it is a mentality that is all about the ""short term"" and the ""I got mine, screw everyone else"" (IMO, and others (Roubini, William K. Black, etc) agree with me -- THAT is a form of sociopathy, and it is exactly what you are exhibiting). 

&gt;Could the US government become communist and seize all my assets? Can't rule it out. Could I get attacked and killed by a bear? Can't rule that out either. Both risks exists, but hiding in a bunker for your entire life is nuts, and far from a reasonable investment analysis.

Could a housing bubble exist? Could the whole Real Estate market collapse? Would a dramatic drop occur in the stock market as a result? etc...  Those risks were likewise ""dismissed"" and not seen as ""reasonable"" by the vast majority of investors.

I also see that you misunderstand the applicability of mathematical models -- you mistake a lack of ""precision"" for a lack of ""accuracy"".  Unless a mathematical model can tell you WHICH stock to invest in for a maximum (short term) speculative gain... you (foolishly) dismiss it as worthless.

But that's only a problem with your (false) understanding and expectations -- it is not what mathematical models are about.

A mathematical model *cannot* (for example) predict the exact flight path of each pellet from a shotgun -- a direct analogy to whether it can predict stocks BTW -- but it CAN predict the breadth of the scatter, what percentage of pellets will hit within a certain radius of the center, the diameter of that radius at various distances, etc.  

And it can definitely predict that if you are foolish enough to stare down the barrel of a loaded shotgun while pulling the trigger that you will get a face-full of pellets, and the ""apocalyptic"" consequence of that is that you will suffer severe damage and trauma as a result, and will very likely be dead.

The housing bubble was a whole bunch of idiots (buyers AND bankers {and the uninformed/duped investors backing them}) who were doing pretty much exactly that in a financial sense -- staring down the barrel of a shotgun and pulling the trigger.

Similar things are true of our economy in general -- we are rhyming history and repeating malinvestment and resource management mistakes that are hauntingly *similar* to previous failed civilizations.

**BTW, the fact that you think the only ""option"" (other than blindly *ignoring* risks) is to ""hide in a bunker"" is pretty psychologically enlightening... (it is the infantile response of a child to run and hide -- real adults face risks, plan for them, and deal with them when they occur).**

And the majority of the population is too busy navel-gazing, penny counting, and gambling for winnings at the local casino to look up and see the coming problems -- much less are they interested in *doing* anything about it (that's someone *else's* job) -- instead they (like you) prefer to play ""let's pretend"" and then go back to their party and games... wahoo!

Never the less, (probably because I am the aforementioned ""dick"" / ""jackass"")  I I'll try one last time, then you can call me a Nazi and Godwin's law will save me from further comments.

Here is my argument in simple economic terms (which in a subject as emotional as loving your children, will surely fail to convince anyone and get me downvoted - AGAIN).

If before you have kids you have the money / opportunity / ability / time to do lots of things that make you very ""happy"" (whatever they are -- travel, build a business, eat out, work for politcal change, get drunk, feed the homeless, play board games, spend 80 hours a week researching a cure for cancer, train for a marathon, paint, learn farsi - whatever) you are accumulating LOTS of benefits.

If, after you have kids you can no longer do some protion (ar any portion) of these things the the cost of having children is very high it offsets enourmous benefits. Of course it provides benefits as well, but this doesn't change the high costs.

On the other hand, if before you had kids you were not able to do as many (or perhaps very few things) that made you very ""happy"", when you have kids the cost is lower, (you didn't have to give up as much). You got the same (or perhaps even greater) benefits from having kids but at a lower cost.

So now I become the jack ass / dick  again...

If you have a great life:

 * love
 * friends
 * plenty of money
 * work you care about
 * a creative outlet
 * a sense that what you are doing is meaningful and important

Having kids is probably harder on you than if you had a less great life...

 * love
 * friends
 * some money -- but not so much that you can spend it without thinking
 * a job you don't much like
 * no creative outlet
 * sense that what you are doing really matters in the world.

In life two having a kid not only comes at a lower cost (you had less to give up) it may provide some additional benefits, life now seems to have a greater purpose, the work you do (caring for your child) is work you care about etc.

Although, in truth, I'd take a good pump shotgun over any other for dealing with zombies.  Maybe a good .45 as a sidearm, but I'd use the shotgun as the primary.  Just about everyone has shotguns, so the shells wouldn't be too hard to obtain, and one shot from a shotgun would almost guarantee you one dead (non-moving anyway) zombie.  "

Just because the article strives to make the point by putting our military spending into a context that balances it against our budget or population size doesn't mean that the notion of the US as a warmongering nation is untrue (it doesn't mean the opposite is true either). Rather than try to marginalize someone who wants to point out some facts that go beyond the data in the article, why not engage the argument in an honest, meaningful way?

I think the article provides an interesting perspective. I don't think you can possibly say the data is conclusive--esp. in that it takes such a calculated view of the data. 

If you read carefully, you may notice that both Israel and Jordan get high marks for spending. Where do you think the lion's share of their military funding comes from? In Jordan's case, the article's author makes it patently clear that we fund their military spending, in part, so we can then lean on them to put peace keeping forces into places where US forces would be disruptive.

t3_bl9s6,Pets,11,0, urban ,"Shared pet? I hope you two are planning on living together for the next 15 years at least. You should make an agreement as to who really owns the cat. Especially once it comes to vet bills and continuous purchase of litter, food, toys, etc. I have a feeling things might not always be so ""shared,"" and this can lead to the kind of arguments that are detrimental to friendships and living situations. 

Definitely keep her inside. Outside walks are okay, I guess, but be careful. My parents moved cross-country with a cat, and put him on a harness so he wouldn't do his business in hotel rooms, but he figured out how to slip out of it pretty quickly. Luckily, he never got too far, but they were in a large parking lot, and not on a city street. Barn cats are one thing, but an urban environment especially is no place for a cat to roam free-range. 

Buy it a few toys (or make your own with strings and paper and whatnot... kittens and most cats will play with just about anything), play with it regularly, keep the litter box clean, and you should be fine. As far as the litterbox goes, generally all you have to do is show the cat where it is, and they'll know what to do. My personal preference has always been clumping litter. It keeps things much cleaner inside the box, and I find it to be better with odor control. Some people insist on biodegradable cat litter, but if you're going to be throwing it out in a plastic trash bag, I think biodegradability becomes a bit of a moot point. Also, I've known plenty of people's cats who've refused to use anything but typical clay-type cat litter, so your cat may not even want to use the pine or newspaper stuff. 

With kittens, you should always be on the lookout for chewing, though. Kittens will often try to chew wires, which is obviously a very bad thing. I believe i've read that rubbing an orange peel on surfaces will deter this behavior, but if that doesn't work, you can buy bitter spray at pet stores that discourages chewing. Be careful, though, it will get on your hands and make your fingers taste horrifically bitter if you forget it's there and touch a surface you've sprayed. "

Tips:

*  Have the right gear.  I'd google ""backpacking essentials"" or something similar and then look at about 20 sites.  Once you realize they're all listing the same things, make note (a literal checklist) of those things and take every one of them.  I learned outdoor skills in the Army and the single most important lesson I think I learned was to be prepared.  If you're two days from anything resembling a store or sink and you run out of water you're in serious trouble.  If you think you won't need it, some guy named Murphy will show up and prove you wrong.  You also need to know how to use them - set up your tent, light your campstove, etc.

*  Know the correct way to pack a backpack.

*  Make sure you know basic first aid before you go.  Even something as simple as a minor infection (from something as inocuous as a bug bite or scrape) or sprained ankle could make your life VERY difficult.

*  Have a compass and map and **KNOW HOW TO USE THEM**.  The compass is pretty easy, actually, (Spoiler alert: it points north) but orienting a map and reading contour lines takes a bit of practice.

*  When you're hiking, turn around and look behind you constantly.  The look of a trail and your surroundings heading in one direction is often very different than heading back.  Also, keep your head and eyes up.  Staring at the ground will do you more harm than good.

*  It wouldn't hurt to know what each of [these](http://espanol.istockphoto.com/file_thumbview_approve/3766117/2/istockphoto_3766117-animal-tracks.jpg) are - or at least which ones should make you nervous - especially if they look fresh or new.

*  Plan your route - in detail - before you even pack.  Then tell someone (I actually recommend telling two someones - a parent or the like and a local ranger station in the area you'll be in) when you're leaving, where you plan on staying each night, and when you'll be back.  Then stick to that plan.  If someone needs to come after you they shouldn't have to guess where you are.  It also ensures you know what you're getting yourself into.

Why is that every single white man is always considered (by everyone but white men) to have had privileged entry to all that society offers?

Is it beyond all possibility to be a poor white man and be denied elements of society taken for granted by other social groups. I and many poor white men I know could give a slew of anecdotal evidence but that's it there isn't any serious organization studying the effects of modern society on a group of whom everyone assumes to be privileged (to my knowledge.)   

The accepted notion that the denial of one group equates to the privilege of another group is also wrong. Black people say *all* white people enjoy privilege, feminists say *all* white men enjoy privilege. The most hypocritical to me are Latino people, whose ancestors might very well have been European invaders themselves complaining about white privilege (all of the sudden it kicks in when you get to America, we truly are the home of the disadvantaged.) 

I am not saying that groups haven't faced oppression and discrimination but once groups like Jews, Italians and Poles were not even considered white in America. This was pretty much up until their many sons fought in WWII. Now it isn't really that they gained acceptance in society through heroism and honor; but no simply because the GI Bill thrust many of them into middle class and they subsequently decided to move their families out of the crowded urban cities and into the suburbs - Which has now recently been determined to be a form of racism and termed ""white flight.""

Really the only quantifiable factor that decides privilege in a capitalist society is the amount of capital or wealth you have. All those other isms tend to simply accumulate wealth in another privileged individual's coffers and divide the poor masses amongst themselves. 

Granted women have been also an extremely oppressed and exploited group. They fought and won fundamental rights to equality like voting and discrimination in the workplace. Overcoming that history in America was a hard fought battle that still continues to an extent. 

But OP is pointing out that women are now being afforded privileges that are unequal as a result of the real history and this is wrong to him as it is creating discontent and an unfair workplace.

Its one thing to be feminist and fight against the practice of clitoridectomy in Africa or the treatment and oppression of women (like being stoned to death for breaking marriage vows) in fundamentalist Muslim countries but it is another thing to expect that because of historical abuses towards women like this, women in America should be given ten extra minutes of break time for feminine needs. Its is really a slap in the face.

t3_bkvsk,Libertarian,1,0, transportation ,"&gt;If your university is anything like the ones I know, there's a large parking shortage.

In this case you're actually not correct.  Mine is one of the few universities where there isn't a parking shortage (I know that's unusual).  It's simply in an inconvenient downtown location.  Presumably everyone hates fighting traffic just to get to school, so they take public transportation instead.  The train goes directly past our campus and there are parking locations at the train stations (which are where many of the students actually park).  So, because of where my particular campus is situated, the public transportation lots are actually eating most of the student parking problem and the lots on the campus are usually nowhere near full.

&gt;I'm not really sure what you're getting at, because I'm not sure what you're calling socialized, what you're calling bad, and what you're calling good.

People have a choice in how they get to the campus.  However they choose to get to the campus they currently have to pay for the public transportation fee.  If you drive to the campus, you're still paying into the fund for everyone else to use the train/bus system.  That means that some people are subsidizing others - it makes my commute 'cheaper' overall...except that it doesn't.  In this case the simple fact that people are made to pay for it whether they use it or not is driving up consumption of the service.

Think about it.  There's a precise parallel to socialized medicine systems in various countries.  Everyone pays in, so everyone feels entitled to go for *everything*, trivial or not.  That creates a shortage which usually manifests itself in an economic system as a higher cost, or if spending is fixed (as in most socialized medicine systems), a longer wait to see a doctor (usually *much* longer).

In this case, the additional demand created is driving up the cost of consumption of the service: it costs more for *everyone* because people are consuming the socialized service.

&gt;If it was a %100 private funded university, using %100 private roads, would it still be socialism to take the %100 voluntarily obtained money/resources, and somehow direct how people get around campus?

There isn't anything *voluntary* about it.  Even if you don't use the service, you pay.  It's an analog to a tax for any other social service.  If each individual paid for their own transportation then, no, there's nothing socialistic about it.  Because there is one group paying and one group consuming (with some overlap) then yes, it is.

The author is not making an ecological nor a political case, simply a long-term investment one. An analogous statement might be phrased:

*If and when things like oil, coal, etc become significantly more expensive (either due to scarcity, political restrictions, etc), people will find more of it, or will find ways to use it more efficiently, or will find substitutes for it.

t3_bktbz,programming,2,0, train ,"&gt;Do you understand how dynamic loading works on AIX? For a well-layered C++ application you can have much better memory performance than a large J2EE app.

This has nothing to do with *deployment*. 

Furthermore, it depends on your app. If your performance bottle neck is in the application startup, you have more specific requirements than the vast majority of people. 

Congratulations, you're using the right tool for the job.

&gt;We cluster C++ servers and that works very well for load balancing and high performance. The J2EE application clustering is much more primitive from what I have seen.

This is meaningless. It depends entirely on your app servers. Some do it more transparently than others. What app server are you using? How are you clustering? What is your messaging infrastructure? Are you doing some fancy voodoo or are you throwing an apache reverse proxy in front of things? 

&gt;J2EE is much worse for performance.

Obviously. It's running in a virtual machine. But the consensus is that amortized over time it's roughly in the same order of magnitude of performance.

With the added benefit (SIGH, I can't believe I'm defending j2ee) that developers are easier to train and apps are easier to debug. 

Engineering is a set of tradeoffs. If you need to minimize latency, go as close to the metal as possible. If you need to maximize throughput on an easy to parallelize problem, pick a more expressive language and throw more machines at it.

t3_bddbh,science,1,0, train ,"&gt; No it wouldn't. Energy is not being ""expended"". That is your word.

No, *that is your word* -- you started this thread [by asking about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bddbh/hows_this_for_a_theory/c0m8jzg):

&gt; What do you guys mean by ""expend energy""?

I answered, and over time explained that an expenditure of energy requires a change in velocity, i.e. an acceleration. ""Expenditure of energy"" means kinetic energy. You have been making this precise argument since the beginning. If you want to insist on potential energy, I have some bad news for you:

* Potential energy cannot involve acceleration, that is reserved to kinetic. If you want to argue that acceleration is present, you must also argue for kinetic energy.

* Your use of potential energy is a dodge, for a number of reasons including that everything that isn't kinetic energy is potential energy, including all masses.

&gt; Standing still you have 0 linear velocity yet you are being accelerated.

False. Now that you have departed reality, this is a good place to stop -- a moment when you summarize your complete ignorance of physics, or even [acceleration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration): ""In physics, and more specifically kinematics, *acceleration is the change in velocity over time.*""

Therefore, based on how acceleration is defined by people who are not ignorant jackasses, and because acceleration is the time derivative of velocity, no change in velocity means no acceleration. As to a rotating object, no change in angular velocity means no acceleration.

&gt; On earth there is a standard value for gravitational acceleration.

That's true, but if your velocity is not changing, you do not experience acceleration and there is no kinetic energy. For example, an object sitting on the surface of the earth, neither rising nor falling through the gravitational field, experiences no change in velocity, therefore no acceleration, therefore no energy is expended.

An object in orbit, same thing -- no acceleration, no change in energy, so the orbit continues unchanged. The fact that the orbit continues without loss of energy proves that there are no accelerations present.

&gt; You are being accelerated even though you are not and cannot move down as long as you are on stable ground.

No one can possibly be this stupid. No motion, no velocity, no acceleration, no kinetic energy. In fact, for any constant velocity including angular velocity, no acceleration, no energy expenditure. Do you seriously think a rock sitting on the earth's surface is being accelerated?

[Static Equilibrium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force#Static_equilibrium) : ""The simplest case of static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object on a level surface is pulled (attracted) downward toward the center of the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, surface forces resist the downward force with equal upward force (called the normal force). The situation is one of zero net force *and no acceleration*."" (emphasis added)

A rock sitting on the earth has a constant position. Velocity is the time derivative of position, and for a constant position, velocity is zero. Acceleration is the time derivative of velocity, and for any constant velocity including zero, there is no acceleration. No acceleration, no motion, no expenditure of energy.

&gt; If direction changes and speed is constant then that is still acceleration.

False for a uniformly rotating object, [as proven by this literature reference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_energy_theorem#Zero_work): ""Work can be zero even when there is a force. The centripetal force in a uniform circular motion, for example, does zero work since the kinetic energy of the moving object doesn't change. *This is because the force is always perpendicular to the motion of the object; only the component of a force parallel to the velocity vector of an object can do work on that object.*"" (emphasis added)

No change in velocity, no acceleration, no energy expenditure. This is why a flywheel doesn't slow down unless acted on.

Your insistence that there is an acceleration *and therefore energy*, as you have repeatedly claimed, forces you to acknowledge that you are speaking of kinetic energy, but this is an error -- if it were true, the flywheel would slow down.

An ideal flywheel with no friction, if given an initial angular velocity, will continue in uniform rotation indefinitely. This is because there is no loss of energy, because there are no accelerations. No change in velocity, no acceleration, no energy.

It's obvious that you have no clue about physics, and a very strange inability to picture physical systems and how they work (so that a railroad train is described as ""ridiculous""). You use physical terms with a perfect disregard for how they are defined and cannot being yourself to look anything up. If I look things up for you, you simply go on as before, without the slightest idea how you look while ignoring the most basic physical principles.

Here is your original claim:

&gt; What makes you say that doesn't happen in the case of rotation? It's almost the definition... Something has to cause something to undergo rotational motion instead of linear motion. A force has to be applied and so energy is required.

If ""energy is required"" to keep a flywheel spinning, the energy must have a source. Without an energy source, the flywheel must slow down and eventually stop. But this is not what a flywheel does.

Also, this --

&gt; A force has to be applied and so energy is required.

-- is simply false. A static force requires no energy and expends no energy.

Every remark you have made in this thread has been either trivially false, a dodge to avoid responsibility for prior remarks, or an attempt to change the subject.

Your irresponsibility and your lies should be legendary. You are the most perfect waste of time I have ever met, and we are done.

That's nothing more than an engineering consideration. We have detailed wind / weather reports that allow very accurate predictions of what the wind, sun and rain does over any period. Wind and solar farms are not placed randomly. They are located where detailed records show they will work. Load factor for modern wind farms is up to ~40% - we know that they work.

====

A man who was found dressed in latex and handcuffs brought a donkey to his room in a Galway city centre hotel, because he was advised ""to get out and meet people,"" the local court heard last week.

Thomas Aloysius McCarney, with an address in south Galway, was charged with cruelty to animals, lewd and obscene behaviour, and with being a danger to himself when he appeared before the court on Friday. He was also charged with damage to a mini-bar in the room, but this charge was later dropped when the defendant said that it was the donkey who caused that damage. Solicitor for the accused Ms Sharon Fitzhenry said that her client had been through a difficult time lately and that his wife had left him and that his life had become increasingly lonely.

""Mr McCarney has been attending counselling at which he was told that he would be advised to get out and meet people and do interesting things. It was this advice that saw him book into the city centre hotel with a donkey,"" she said. She added that Mr McCarney also suffered from a fixation with the Shrek movies and could constantly be heard at work talking to himself saying things like ""Isn't that right, Donkey?""

Supt John McBrearty told the court that Mr McCarney who had signed in as ""Mr Shrek"" had told hotel staff that the donkey was a family pet and that this was believed by the hotel receptionist who the supt said was ""young and hadn't great English.""

Receptionist Irina Legova said that Mr McCarney had told her that the donkey was a breed of ""super rabbit"" which he was bringing to a pet fair in the city. The court was told that the donkey went berserk in the middle of the night and ran amok in the hotel corridor, forcing hotel staff to call the gardai.

McCarney was found in the room wearing a latex suit and handcuffs, the key to which the donkey is believed to have swallowed. He was removed to Mill St station after which it is said he was the subject of much mirth among the lads next door in The Galway Arms.

He was fined ‚Ç¨2,000 for bringing the donkey to the room under the Unlawful Accommodation of Donkeys Act 1837. Other charges were dropped due to lack of evidence."

The assumption being that there is no such thing as a digitally transmitted image that has imperfections. 

The truth is that a different quality cable can indeed make a difference.  

With a lower quality cable you may get degradation of the signal to the point that a few ones and zeroes don't get there, but the majority do and the result is sparkles.  Sparkles are an image quality degradation. 

A better quality cable might be able to carry the signal better and loose less or none of the bits in transit giving you the actual ""perfect"" picture people think of when thinking of digital and HDMI.

How does this relate to CDs?   CDs are digital.  When you read them you either get the data or you don't.  But we all know that you get blips and chirps in CDs sometimes when you don't get all the bits and you get a complete read error when you don't get enough failures.

Motive you ask??

A 1972 article about ‚ÄúThe Population Bomb‚Äù biologist Paul Ehrlich reveals a nascent environmental movement grappling with mass sterilization, climate fears, ‚Äúinternational policy planning‚Äù and redistribution of wealth. The article reveals dramatic parallels to today's modern environmental movement.
According to the June 16, 1972 article in the Boca Raton News. The article, part of the Newsweek Feature Service, was written by William J. Cook and was titled ‚ÄúExpert on population pleased by response.‚Äù
The article reported: ""In 1969, [Ehrlich] said if voluntary birth reduction methods did not work a nation might have to resort to 'the addition of a temporary sterilant to staple food or to the water supply.' The proposal brought a charge from one newspaper critic that Ehrlich was 'worse than Hitler.'"" [Climate Depot's Editor's Note: Ehrlich has had a few moments of candor in recent times and apparently admitted his lack of basic scientific training. See: An Admission finally! 'The Population Bomb's' Paul Ehrlich: 'I wish I'd taken more math in high school and college. That would have been useful' -- 'If he were writing 'The Population Bomb' now, he'd be more careful about predictions' October 8, 2009 &amp; Also see: Relax: Laugh at silly predictions of overpopulation: Climate Depot's Factsheet on Overpopulation ‚Äì 'Is too few people the new 'population problem?']
Ehrlich has also been in the news recently about a 1977 book he co-authored with President Obama's science czar John Holdren titled ‚ÄúEcoscience: Population, Resources, Environment."" The book called for a 'Comprehensive Planetary Regime could control development, distribution of all natural resources.' Also See: White House Science Adviser Holdren and Ehrlich Advocated 'De-Development' of the United States]
The 1972 article continued: ""One of his most controversial position currently is that countries like the United States cannot urge underdeveloped nations to forego industrial development in the interest of ecology while it remains a burgeoning economic force. Two years ago, he and his wife wrote 'Population, Resources, Environment: Issues in Human Ecology.' In it, they urged the U.S. to 'de-develop' and restore its environment to set an example for the emerging countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa.""

t3_bla1j,space,2,0, station ,"&gt;Establishing one of those huge rotating space stations would exhaust earths energy supplies and for what benefit? 

I disagree on this point. Having a huge space-station would be *invaluable*. I highly doubt it would exhaust our resources, and there are many resources to be had on the Moon. But the benefits are innumerable. For one, you ensure that a single rock does not wipe out humanity. For two, you make at station capable of easily building large spaceships which could be used to go out and mine asteroids, do research, build yet more space colonies. The applications are many. Such a thing, in time, could be made to be self-sufficient as well. 

&gt;Colonies on the moon and Mars are no different; huge costs and little returns. At best we could do some robotic mining in space.

The Moon definitely warrants colonies. Mars would need to be proven to contain valuable resources that could not be obtained elsewhere. At the very least it would be useful to colonize Mars for continuity purposes as well as for science research. 

&gt;A person like Michio Kaku should know better but being a futurist crank pays better.

He's got an optimist's brain, so I think you'll find it difficult to persuade him. I'd say the best humanity should hope for is making sustainable colonies in space out to the asteroid belt (for mining purposes). Beyond that, perhaps one day we will send colonies out to Jupiter and Saturn to study those systems and see what they have to offer. Potentially, large colonies could keep pushing to the extents of the solar system, though that would take many hundreds, if not thousands of years to accomplish. Beyond the solar system, however, we would need to be ridiculously advanced in terms of energy production to even attempt crossing the void to another star system, though I suppose if given enough time and luck it might one day be possible."

As an aside to 'real life friends': to get a TV big enough to accommodate split screen multiplayer properly would cost about the same as my PC rig.

t3_bkjlk,australia,2,0, station ,"Limitations

A commonly-held misconception is that WiMAX will deliver 70 Mbit/s over 50 kilometers. In reality, WiMAX can either operate at higher bitrates or over longer distances but not both: operating at the maximum range of 50 km (31 miles) increases bit error rate and thus results in a much lower bitrate. Conversely, reducing the range (to under 1 km) allows a device to operate at higher bitrates. There are no known examples of WiMAX services being delivered at bit rates over around 40 Mbit/s.

Typically, fixed WiMAX networks have a higher-gain directional antenna installed near the client (customer) which results in greatly increased range and throughput. Mobile WiMAX networks are usually made of indoor ""customer-premises equipment"" (CPE) such as desktop modems, laptops with integrated Mobile WiMAX or other Mobile WiMAX devices. Mobile WiMAX devices typically have omnidirectional antennae which are of lower-gain compared to directional antennas but are more portable. In current deployments, the throughput may reach 2 Mbit/s symmetric at 10 km with fixed WiMAX and a high gain antenna. It is also important to consider that a throughput of 2 Mbit/s can mean 2 Mbit/s symmetric simultaneously, 1 Mbit/s symmetric or some asymmetric mix (e.g. 0.5 Mbit/s downlink and 1.5 Mbit/s uplink or 1.5 Mbit/s downlink and 0.5 Mbit/s uplink), each of which required slightly different network equipment and configurations. Higher-gain directional antennas can be used with a WiMAX network with range and throughput benefits but the obvious loss of practical mobility.

Like most wireless systems, available bandwidth is shared between users in a given radio sector, so performance could deteriorate in the case of many active users in a single sector. In practice, most users will have a range of 2-3 Mbit/s services and additional radio cards will be added to the base station to increase the number of users that may be served as required.

Because of these limitations, the general consensus is that WiMAX requires various granular and distributed network architectures to be incorporated within the IEEE 802.16 task groups. This includes wireless mesh, grids, network remote station repeaters which can extend networks and connect to backhaul.

Personally, I like strings mostly so I'm largely deaf to horns even when they're present.

Tchaikovsky's symphonies have always stood out in my mind as having prominent horns.

Beethoven, Mozart and to a lesser extent Bach are great places to start because they're sufficiently popular that they should have some degree of familiarity to you.

Nope.  A dictionary only serves to describe accepted definitions.  It doesn't get to be king and cancel any other definitions.   Sorry buddy, but the language continues to change and expand.

&gt;Your just being silly now. At no time did I suggest ""that everyone deserves etc."" As far as a house, how about at least a community shelter? Instead of a car, how about a free bus pass? And, no of course, no TV - that is not, ""things necessary for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""

Matter of opinion.  Maybe George over there only wants a tv to be happy.  Who are you to define what free items are necessary for happiness?

&gt;At the same time, that doesn't mean that I support your ""right"" or freedom to process weapons grade plutonium in your basement.

Why not?  How about a 1950's chemistry set?  Can I at least say the word ""gun"" quietly to myself in the corner?

The thing about limiting what people can do is that the line never stays in the same place.  It keeps moving toward more restrictions.  Now kids can't even draw something that looks like a gun in bad light without the school administration coming down on them.

How about forgetting about restricting who does what in their basement, as long as it doesn't hurt the neighbors.  If I want to play with plutonium in my basement, and no radiation escapes, is it a problem?  Or should it only be a problem if I hurt the neighbors out of carelessness, and then I should deal with the consequences including reparating them for my mistake?

It's been suggested in libertarian circles that victimless crimes not be crimes, and victims of crimes or errors be reparated by the criminal.  If he can't or won't, then the criminal is shunned by all. 

This seems kind of like a better alternative than trying to enforce unenforcable restrictions and throwing millions into prisons, no?

&gt;The constitution should hardly be the last word of human rights nor a substitute for the advancement of human morality.

The constitution shouldn't have ANYTHING to do with human morality.  All it should be is a limitation of government.  It wasn't written to be a bible.  It was written to keep the government from becoming too powerful.  Even the bill of rights themselves are specifically limitations of government to individuals.

t3_blgnm,AskReddit,98,0, station ,"You want a horror story? You fucking asked for this.

Popular culture will tell you that men are slobs and women are clean and tidy, but I tell you from my days working in a grocery store: *there is no hell so horrific as a public women's bathroom.* I'm sure most women are perfectly decent human beings. But some women...some women scarred me, damaged my brain, while I had to clean that bathroom from age 14 to 16.

The first time I cleaned that bathroom, which was rarely empty but still had to be cleaned every couple of hours, I learned the awkward process of watching a woman enter the bathroom, waiting nearby and asking her if there's anyone else in there when she leaves. Then I knock loudly on the door, crack it open, yell inside to ask if anyone's in there, wait 5 seconds, yell again, wait ten seconds and enter. Despite that process, I still walked in on women who apparently decided it was *less* embarrassing to have a teenage boy walk in on them rather than utter a sound indicating that the room was occupied.

It was always generally a mess in there. Scraps of toilet paper all over the floor. It was always wet. In an often-used men's bathroom, you get kindof a urine sheen over everything near the urinal, but the women's bathroom had standing water, all over the place, all the time. I don't know how that happened, nothing in there leaked or anything. But TP and paper towels all over the place, often apparently just tossed in the general direction of the trash can. Once in a while there are little chunks of various color on the sink and counter. Which you realize are little hunks of various consistencies that have fallen when you go to wipe them up and it leaves a smear of black, blue, purple or red and you realize it's a hunk of highly concentrated dye for facial application: makeup.

I quickly learned what the little boxes with lids bolted to the side of the inside of the stalls were for, and that you should *never ever ever* **ever** leave them without a liner. Because they will still be used. Males ignorant of female bathroom habits may ask, ""Used for what?"" Feminine products. Used. Feminine products. But they were typically inside a little plastic liner with an assload of toilet paper in there. Sometimes there wasn't a liner in there, and it was not pleasant getting the contents out.

I also learned that a fair number of women *ignore the fucking box* and drop their shit right into the toilet. That is so much worse. The most common thing that happens is the toilet backs up. It's not any nastier than any other toilet backup, and it takes a while to realize why the women's toilets back up about once a week and you can't remember the last time the men's did. There's a reason some public toilets fire water down the pipe like a fucking jet engine...and we didn't have those. Anyway, then the day comes when some woman doesn't bother to flush, and you enter the stall, toilet brush and cleaner in hand to see...red. The water's just kinda pinkish, like you see in the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, and right there in the middle is the culprit: vampire lollipop.

Oh, and sometimes there's drops of blood on the toilet seat. Once in a while you're graced with what can only be properly described as *chunks*.

And then there was the day from hell. I swear to god, a succubus from the pits of *the inferno* came up to use the women's bathroom at my god-forsaken store (in the middle of upper-middle-class midwestern suburbia) that day. I walk into the bathroom and it's the first thing I notice. It's right there, in the middle of the floor. There's more toilet paper than usual strewn about, but nothing can hide it. In the middle of the floor, nowhere near the stalls, lying in a little red pool, practically screaming, ""I was recently in some disgusting person's vagina!""

I assure you, the reaction is involuntary. Your brain tries to puzzle out this conundrum: *whose* vagina was that bloody tampon in? Who left it *in the middle of the floor*? A coworker? That fat lady who was in produce while you were walking up here? The hot 30-something mom whose groceries you sacked just before getting sent over here to clean this den of Satan? Faces and crotches of the women you've recently seen stream by in your mind's eye. You don't know. It could be *any of them*. The combination of confusion and revulsion makes your head spin, and you feel nauseated.

But my prior training in women's bathroom maintenance had desensitized me enough that I was able to choke down the rising bile. For the sake of my mental health I convinced myself it was the sweaty fat lady. I tossed about a gallon of bleach on the fucking thing, and considered throwing ammonia on there, too, because inhaling toxic vapors and permanently damaging my corneas may have been preferable to what I was seeing. I kicked off the lid of the trash can and, with a mop, slid the tampon over to the wall, where I lifted it up to the point where I could flip it into the bag. I didn't get within 4 feet of that thing. I cleaned that bathroom so well the microbes that survived being exposed to deep space on the International Space Station wouldn't have a chance. I mopped the floor four times, changing the water out twice and using so much cleaner it made my eyes and nose burn. I dumped concentrated sanitizer directly into that trash bag.

I didn't quit that day, but I told my manager I was never cleaning the women's bathroom ever again. He must have seen something in my eyes...my red, burning, pleading, soul-crushingly begging eyes, because he agreed. Fuck women's bathrooms. Fuck them right in the ear."

t3_blhkj,dwarffortress,36,0, train ,"**Getting your Squad to do Something**

* Here's another big stumbling block a lot of people are having - training. It's not quite so simple as just designating a barracks and letting your dwarves have at it anymore - though once you know what to do it's not that complicated, and it gives you a LOT more control over military behaviour than before.
* First thing you should do is designate a barracks somewhere, the same way you would have in the previous version (Though you can also designate barracks from a lot of other object types than beds now - any storage object can also be used to designate a barracks or armoury room).
* Once you've designated a barracks, you'll notice a list of the squads in your fort in the info pane. This is where you set how the squad uses the barracks - it defaults to empty so if you don't do anything here, your squad won't even know the barracks exists. You probably want to at least enable ""Train"" and ""Sleep"", though really what you set here is up to you, it's more important that you know it exists. If you don't have the squad set to ""Train"" at any of your designated barracks, they won't train. There are also options for storing equipment here - I haven't seen my dwarves doing this but I've got them all set to just leave their stuff on even off-duty, so I imagine it's more meaningful if they switch to civvies. There's also a ""Position"" option where you can assign specific beds/storage to specific dwarves. I don't think this is too important unless you REALLY want a particular dwarf to have the NICE armour rack. If they aren't assigned they'll just use whatever they feel like, as normal.
* Now, just designating the barracks won't get them to train - because they're still off-duty. Head back to the military screen and go to the ""Alerts"" tab. This is sort of like the uniform tab in that it's a way to quickly assign specific behaviours to a squad - though unlike the uniform tab you really HAVE to use this one. All squads default to inactive until you set them to an alert level - you can create your own custom alerts but to keep it simple for now, just set a squad to ""Active/Training"". Note that to set a squad alert level, first you scroll down to the alert, then you scroll across to the squad, THEN you hit enter. If you just hit enter on the alert itself, it will set the civilians in the fort to this - for ""Active/Training"" it's essentially meaningless, but you can use this to order civilians to a safe area in the event of an attack (Kind of like the old ""Keep indoors"" option, but much better since they don't keep trying to run out the front door and turning around).
* Once you've set the squad's alert level, head over to the ""Schedule"" tab. Along the top you'll have a list of all the squads in your fort, and on the side will be a list of the game months. Now, this is important, on the VERY top of the screen, above the squad list, is the name of the currently selected alert level. You can change this with the */ buttons on the numpad - what you're doing here is setting the squad's orders for each month when they're set to the selected alert level. If you're on ""Active/Training"", every month probably says ""Train"".
* Here's the thing - the game defaults to a REALLY stupid option that most people are probably going to miss - notice on the bottom, in blue, how it says ""Train, 10 minimum""? What that means is that if you have less 10 dwarves in that squad set to training (Which will always be the case since squads max out at 10), it will FORCE members of the squad to train, even when they're exhausted or starving. If you don't change this, your dwarves will be EXTREMELY miserable after a while - they might even starve to death while training - I'm not sure. Either way, hit ""e"" to edit the order, and use the /*-+ buttons to set the minimum to something like 1 or 2 less than the number of dwarves you have in your squad.
* If you hit ""o"" while on this screen, you can scroll through all the other options for orders you can give your squads. All of them except for Train will require you to set either burrows or notes while I'll explain in the next section. For now just leave it on train.
* Don't forget that orders are set per month - so you only set the minimum down for one month. Copy/paste the order into all the other months. Alternatively, if you want to give your dwarves time off, you can just hit x on an order and it will set them to inactive for that month. You can also use ""o"" to give them more than one order during a given month, though I'm not sure how this works (My guess is that if you set your minimums properly, the squad will split evenly between the two activities to maintain the minimum values of both).
* If you've set everything I mentioned above, your dwarves SHOULD spend some time training in the barracks now. Bear in mind this is a new release and pretty buggy, and dwarves weren't exactly rocket scientists in the last version either, so it might seem like they spend a lot of time waiting around for an instructor or instructee. If you just leave them alone and don't worry about it, eventually they'll figure it out and start getting some training done."
t3_blhkj,dwarffortress,32,0, station ,"**Burrows and Notes**

* This is a more advanced feature of the new military options - it's similar to the old station and patrol options, but a lot more flexible because of the new alert level settings.
* First things first - if you want your dwarves to guard an area, you need to set a burrow. It's pretty self-explanatory how to do that once you hit ""w"" from the main menu - just cover the area you want the dwarves to defend. Note that bigger is better here, at least if you want your dwarves to cover a wide area. Dwarves will detect intrusions into a burrow, and if they're set to guard that burrow, they'll immediately run to the point of the intrusion - so don't set the burrow to one square to try to get the dwarves to stand at the entrance or something. Just set it to the area you want guarded.
* Burrows have a few other uses as well - you can assign civilians to burrows and what that means is that they'll only use things that are in that burrow - workshops, dining rooms, etc. Note that they'll still gather material from outside the burrow if it's not close at hand, so don't worry about dwarves starving in a burrow because there's no food in it.
* Notes are how you set a patrol route. This is a bit more complicated than it used to be, but essentially, first you have to plant notes at all the points you want the dwarves to patrol, then you need to hit ""r"" from the note menu to bring up the routes list, and create a new patrol route and then add waypoints to it. It might seem excessively cumbersome, but the reason behind this is that you can use the same points for multiple patrol routes, if you want different squads to follow different paths.
* For either of these, once you've set up the burrow/route, you can set a squad to use them via the ""Schedule"" screen, the same way you edit their training schedule. You can also set dwarves to just stand at a particular note like the old station option, but honestly using burrows sounds better to me. A good idea is probably to create a new alert level for ""Active"" duty versus just training, so you can quickly have switch your dwarves between patrolling and training.
* There's also a ""Burrows"" header on the alerts tab of the military menu. To be honest, I don't actually know what this does. My guess is it's used to send civilians to certain burrows if you set the civilian alert level to a burrow restricted alert.


**Direct Control**

* This is probably the simplest thing to figure out of all the new options, but I figure I might as well be thorough. First thing is open the squad menu with ""s"" and select a squad with a,b,c etc. (You can also select multiple squads by holding down shift and selecting a squad). Honestly, from here it's pretty intuitive. Just hit the appropriate button for the order you want to give, pick a target, and watch them go.
* You can also give orders to individual members of squads by toggling from ""Select squads"" to ""Select individuals"" with p, then selecting a squad and picking someone/multiple people from inside it."

&gt;One million LEDs mounted to the inside of the dome of a sports arena is not the same thing as having the entire inside surface of the dome emitting light.

True, but saying the celestial dome is mostly dark is missing the point. It is full of galaxies at very tiny resolutions, we just can't see the light from these galaxies unless we train sensitive instruments on them for many minutes.

Of course, the highest any of those First team robots place was 2nd, so maybe you need the extra $23,000 to win first place?  Or maybe it's for transportation and lodging?

I just looked at the bottom of your page, and now I see your problem.  You are paying retail for everything!

Seriously, everywhere I've mentioned I was into robotics, I've met amateur machinists who eagerly volunteered their equipment, time and services.  If you go on Craigslist or Ebay, you might have to pay $2500 to fill your shopping list.  You certainly won't be getting modern, CNC machines.

t3_blgis,anime,6,0, train ,"Big O isn't very popular among the anime community, but I'd recommend it.  It was actually a bigger hit in the US than in Japan due to the popularity of the dub on Adult Swim.  The premise: basically, you have Bruce Wayne in a giant mecha.

Planetes is another ""atypical"" anime show.  It's sci-fi, set in space, but it doesn't follow any common anime tropes.  It's frighteningly realistic: the story focuses on a group of blue-collar workers (garbage collectors in space) and they have to deal with things like internal politics rather than things like alien conflict.  If you're a fan of western sci-fi shows like Star Trek, definitely check Planetes out.

Baccano! is a good starter, because it doesn't require any understanding of Japanese culture to enjoy.  Here's my standard Baccano! plug copy/pasted from another thread:

&gt;Set in Prohibition-era America, the series follows events taking place in 1930, 1931, and 1932, narrating all three threads in tandem. There's thieves, mafia gangsters, a comedy duo, terrorist cult members, an elixir of immortality and all manner of pulp fiction elements, and their paths all happen to converge on a single train in 1931. Brawls, gunfights, and very unhealthy levels of violence ensue. Along the way, there flashbacks and flashforwards to tie everything together. More than two dozen distinct characters participate in the story, and of those over half are introduced in the OP. The title, ""Baccano,"" is Italian for ""ruckus"" or ""commotion"" and you should expect to get what it says on the tin. The episode names are also fairly good at advertising their contents explicitly in the title. For example, episode 4, titled ""Ladd Russo Enjoys Talking A Lot and Slaughtering A Lot,"" is predictably about Ladd Russo, who spends most of the time talking a lot and slaughtering a lot (and enjoying both). In episode 6, ""The Rail Tracer Covertly, Repeatedly Slaughters Inside the Coaches,"" expect to see the rail tracer slaughtering people inside the coaches, and doing so in a covert manner, repeatedly."

t3_blh1s,AskReddit,1,0, bus ,"I have to qualify your statement. A graphics card is separate from the motherboard, it's an actual addon card. There are however graphics chips that are part of the motherboard, these are called onboard video. Onboard simply implies that the chip is integrated into the motherboard (you'll also see the term in my above reply with regard to ethernet controllers, sound chips, and RAID controllers, it just means the motherboard comes with that functionality built in).

And typically a graphics card is much faster than an onboard graphics chip since it will have a dedicated GPU and dedicated VRAM (video RAM). An onboard video chip will use your CPU and RAM to do the same tasks. For your purposes an onboard graphics chip will simply not suffice for any kind of rendering/encoding.

edit: Also while I'm at it, a ""controller"" is simply a fancy name for a device the directs information to the proper place, so a RAID controller for example will handle where to put the data that the CPU sends down the bus (data line) to the proper hard drive since RAID implies multiple hard drives."

t3_blh9x,BDSMcommunity,6,0, bus ,"I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was sexually molested by a boy I thought was a friend when I was 16. There was nothing kinky associated with it at all, but I think that, maybe like your situation, its similar in that I thought this was someone I could trust and it turned out much differently. Dealing with triggers can be very hard, especially because even though you could fully understand why these things effect you, it could feel near impossible to control the reaction. For me, certain sexual acts, a certain movie, a certain food, and a particular bus stop are examples of triggers. You can help yourself cope better with triggers as/after they're happening by asking your therapist to review specific exercises with you that you can practice. Once I felt strong enough to start confronting my triggers, i would purposely expose myself to them and actively practice different ways of controlling and reforming how I thought and reacted in the moment. But with triggers like specific sexual acts, for example, you can't really start to re-acclimate yourself to it unless you have a partner you can really trust, someone who knows your background and who will take all the baby steps you need, someone you have learned to trust as much as possible. 

I think it is definitely possible for you to heal and grow and beat those triggers, and even be able to enjoy what you used to again if you chose to go back to it. Its important to remember though that you can only heal yourself so much on your own. Eventually you have to come to trust someone again in order to completely heal. Its ok if you can't do it all by yourself, and its also important to remember its ok if you can't or don't want to do these things indefinitely. Just because you did it before, you aren't required to keep doing it. Its ok for whats happened in your life to change your preferences or desires. If you don't want to go back to the things you used to do, but still feel there's something missing, that's only natural. It'd be no different if you were a gold medal swimmer who retired swimming. Discover something new about yourself, find another interest to fill the time and focus you would normally have given to bdsm in the past. Remember not to focus so much on the one thing you may be missing so much that you become blind to all the various things you still have.

You could go to the doctor and get the prescription, and then tell your parents that it's for depression, and then go through how you are starting to feel like you are getting to that place where you MIGHT start thinking about suicide and that you want to head it off at the pass. Tell them it's a real condition just like a broken bone, or listening to country &amp; western music;-) Think around the situation, and how to best minimize any fall out from your parents freaking out. Here's the deal on your parents: They obviously love you, but they don't know how to respond to the situation, so instead they react. You could also write them a letter about the reason you got the prescription and that you are trying to handle your condition, and that with their support you'll have a great chance at keeping it under control. Then...and I'm serious here....tell them that you love them, and that you are afraid of hurting them, so that's why you're on the meds....then later on, you go and accept your Academy Award;-) In all seriousness, they need to know you're all right, and that you're doing this for not only you, but for them. Speaking as a parent, who wants to have their kid thinking about suicide? See things from their perspective as hard as that may be, and you'll have an insight into how to handle them.

Bottom line, you have to get this looked after because you and I both know that if this is left unchecked it can get worse, and that's not what you or your parents, or your girlfriend, or even me want for you. You're 16, and you literally have your whole life ahead of you!

I want you to start to only think to the next day, and not look down the road so much. Be cognisant of the future, but you're only going to think as far as tomorrow. That's what is getting me through university, and I wish someone had given me that advice when I was in high school.

Oh, I just had another thought, if you were write a letter to your parents, and ask them to sit down and read it they'll probably be receptive to that. Make sure that you are clear that you are starting to feel depressed, and that you don't want to be in that place where you MIGHT feel suicidal, so you'd like to see your family doctor to see about getting on some antidepressants. Ensure that you add in that you love them, and that you need their support...yeah, I think that could work!:-)

You can do this, and I'd like to point out that I didn't have a girlfriend until I was 19 years old, so you're way, way, way ahead of me in that department."

t3_blfku,politics,2,0, rail ,"&gt;The marketplace you and your entrepreneur friends enjoy now exists specifically because companies like Microsoft were spanked by governments in the US and Europe for anti-competitive behavior.

The same sort of startup-heavy software environment generally does *not* exist in Europe; I know a great many people who have moved to the US because such an environment is more startup-friendly.  The US restrictions on Microsoft were pretty laughable and promptly dropped -- harm that Microsoft sees is because another company (Apple) or a collection of technology enthusiasts and companies (Linux) is moving in, not because of any sort of effective limitations placed by the government.  I can't speak as to the restrictions placed by *every* European government, but generally I have a hard time seeing how those did much to encourage Microsoft to open up the application space; the most extreme example is probably the Media Player/MSIE restrictions, and just what is the real-world impact of that?

But they [EDIT: robber barons, the railroad moguls, just to be clear] had

(a) a government-subsidized monopoly -- there were major incentives granted to create railroads and drive western expansion and hence establish permanent land claims for the US.  These would not be available to later competitors.

(b) Their industry sees [natural monopolies](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Natural_monopoly).  There's no sense and great marginal expense in establishing two separate rail lines to a city.  I will happily recognize that natural monopolies can cause (sometimes quite severe) market failure.

t3_blja8,AskReddit,0,0, station ,"OK now, the radio station transmitter is most likely NOT sending out a dirty signal.  Interference like this happens all the time.  Sometimes it can be easily fixed, and other times not.  

In days long past, every station used to have a good engineer on the staff and they would always be willing to help someone with interference resolve the problem.  Trouble is, any more that permanent staff position went away as part of a cost cutting measure for all but the largest, wealthiest stations.  When they need an engineer they most likely hire one by the hour.  Good luck getting him over to your house on their nickle.  

The basic problem is that the wires in your system act like antennas.  The RF signal from the station is strong enough to be picked up and carried into your amplifier where it interacts with the amplifiers and gets amplified also.  This is particularly a problem with high impedance circuits operating at very low voltage levels, which describes the turn-table input to your component system.

Grounding was suggested and might help, but sometimes it also exacerbates the problem (by becoming a better part of the antenna system picking up signals).  Visit the ARRL website and look up the EMI/RFI interference technical support page at http://www.arrl.org/tis/info/rfigen.html.  Amateur radio operators (operating at power levels a fraction of that used by broadcast transmitters) deal with interference of this type to their neighbors all the time and have hundreds of tricks you can try.

Let us know what ended up fixing your problem."

t3_bl5w8,worldnews,1,0, urban ,"Disclaimer: These are my personal observation.

I think the matter at hand is more of a urban-rural divide than that of caste. In urban area, most of the effects of caste system have vanished in overtly form, much like I think about how fight against racism has progressed in the West. There is still some hidden malice inside urban population, but nothing overt to it. 

  Thus, if you have a family in urban area, and is almost well to do, that is to say is able to realize importance of education and subsequently send their children to schooling, it is very easy to get in college with or without reservation, and with subsidized fees/ bank loan. A lot of my friends in college/home town were of backward class, but I never realized that till there was government job opening, or college selection. In this sense, along with the booming economy, getting out of cycle of poverty is fairly easy.

  In the rural area however, the caste system is still rampant, and ranges everywhere from stopping lower caste people to attend the temple, to having each group of people do certain set of jobs, and no more. If one is lower caste person in a village, most probably he won't be able to send his kids to school. Add to the mix traditions like child marriage and like, and general unawareness about population control. benefit of education, etc, the poor find themselves in vicious cycle of poverty. 

  And then there is general problem that plagues India, like corruption, general inefficiency, the mentality of thinking government as the ruler and not the servant and like, that really hampers any thing good to come out of our democracy. But it hits the poorest the hardest. "

If you try to speak basic jap (like please/thank you/where is~) they'll fall over themselves to help you, and most people (esp younger) have some kind of English.   
As for transportation... well Tokyo subway system is much like an overturned bowl of noodles - covering 3 different companies requiring 3 different tickets. Best to ask if you need to use it.  
 The train system however, is your friend - the JR loop line circles most of the touristy stuff and is very easy to navigate.

That ultimately depends on you--do you want to stay in hostels, guesthouses, or budget hotels, or fancy rooms?   Japanese hostels tend to be farther out of the center of the city, but that's no big deal for someone who enjoys learning the public transportation systems (myself included!).  All in all, expect about what you would pay if you were to visit Paris or Rome on a budget.

&gt; It would also involve a lot more forward planning as I would have to book time off way in advance.

I completely understand but I must say ""that's too bad.""  FWIW, things aren't always cheaper when you book in advance.   Planes, maybe, but I have had success finding cheap tickets three days before the flight.

As an American who's lived outside SF, I must say it's a very enjoyable city but for some reason I can't place it on the level of ""awesomeness"" that you experience in the east.

If you don't stay with a host family I really hope you stay in a place where there's a communal area with other travelers so you can talk to and meet others.  What are you scared of?  Dying?

An older gentlemen came in looking for a specific book. The store was pretty low-tech (one of the reasons they hired me was to help them with a new fancy-dancy point of sale system)... so I walked him over to the bookshelves and we looked through for it.

He was friendly as could be, making quaint older person small talk with a younger guy like me... until he found out that I was attending the local ""Catholic"" college... I say ""Catholic"" because everyone considers it ""Catholic Light""... there is nothing religious about the school other than it's got a lot of Franciscan monks walking around and teaching and there's a church on campus.  

Once he learned of my enrollment at said school, he promptly did a complete bi-polar 180 and accused me, not only of having pre-marital sex (guilty), but of being part of numerous abortions.  Apparently going to Catholic school that doesn't take a huge stance on abortion means all students enrolled are deviant sex-crazed lunatics who must have constant abortions.  He pulled a pamphlet out of his inside coat pocket with pictures of aborted fetus's from the third trimester... I was too shocked and embarrassed by his behavior to tell him that such things are illegal.   

TLDR: Nice old man becomes crazy religious nut when I tell him where I go to school.

*****

Another story about the store:  It gets very slow there in the summer.  There are no real religious holidays, events, or occasions for church's or church-going people to buy things for, so it gets pretty boring.  When you've spent the last 3 or 4 hours standing there and MAYBE talking to 3 or 4 customers, you start watching the clock and you can't WAIT to go run to the door and lock it. 

It was time to leave, I ran to the door and was in the process of locking it when a bus full of nuns pulled in and walked towards me.  You can't make this kind of thing up... a bus-load of nuns.  How do you lock nuns out of a store?  Especially when they're in large numbers and using public transportation.  I have news for you:  nuns are very slow shoppers.  I was there for a good hour and a half longer.... teeth gritted and smiling.  We ended up selling 3 holy cards to this bus-load of nuns.  Thats $3 in sales, not taxed.

The closest they can legally get would be in the vicinity of the metro station outside of the cemetery.  She also said that if they tried to demonstrate, or picket, or protest inside the cemetery, that the Park Police would stop them**. 

Based on that conversation and on reading the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, I am confident that the internment service for Sgt. Santos-Silva will be both peaceful and dignified.  While I continue to urge that military personnel in the area attend the service to pay their respects to a fallen comrade, I do not believe that any additional activity to silence Phelps and his WBC during the internment service is required.

Is the AR15 a far better balanced rifle for civilian and law enforcement work, where it will remain in a gun case, inside a closet, or in a rack until such time as its services are required? 150% yes, they're built for that controlled environment. Are there better designs for inclement weather and environments (typical wartime situations) that don't give up any accuracy potential or ergonomics? Once again, 150% yes - the AR compromises a bit in those environments, there are other designs that do not (SIG 551 immediately springs to mind...).


I like AR15s for what they are - great urban rifles. I don't like the idea of living in urban environment any more, and outside of those controlled environments the AR takes a backseat to other more reliable designs. Hell, select-fire assault rifles and their semiauto clones in general, including AKs, take a backseat to battle rifles the second you leave those short-range environs. 


In wartime, should I be given a choice between an AKM and an AR15, I will pick an AR15 every time, but I will do so without delusion - it is not a reliable rifle in those circumstances (the very circumstance it was supposedly designed for, hell on earth). There *will* be 100mph tape applied to every shitty non-Magpul magazine issued to me, and there *will* be a condom over the muzzle. Should the choice instead be SIG 551 or AR15? That SIG rifle kicks the holy hell out of the AR15 without sacrificing accuracy. I'll grab that SIG and never look back. It wins because it does accuracy and cost (at the military contract level) as well as an AR15, but it's inherently more reliable - in other words, *a better design*. If I'm arming a nation's military I wouldn't pick the AR15 ever for any reason, but those things are done by committees filled with politicians who are more concerned about appearances and kickbacks than welfare of their own troops (as evidenced by insane bans on personal body armor that are own troops have had to endure periodically).

He believes most people are evil and if you're doing what's right people will dislike you (many of us on Reddit believe this also, just not to the extreme).

There is no evidence of deliberate brainwashing.  If you want to call it brainwashing then it's nothing unlike what most extremely religious (or really, extremely anything) parents do to their children everyday.  No evil intentions, just ignorance.

Fred cannot practice law, he was disbarred for legally harassing a witness.  Just like everyone he has been unethical at times, he has a ridiculous temper, and he obsesses over justice at all costs.  He started Phelps Charter and they had not started picketing until a few years after he was disbarred.

They do specifically try to provoke responses.  They believe their god says they should tell sinners they are sinners, though there is no hope of salvation (they believe in pre-destination), and gain as much attention in doing so as possible (I don't remember the versus they quoted, but when I heard them it made a decent amount of sense).  They target homosexuality specifically because of an incident where a pedophile tried to entice one of Fred's grandchildren while he was out on a bike ride with them.  The Phelps' tried to put more security in the park but the local counsel refused, the Phelps' in their anger used inflammatory language and gay rights groups got involved, the Phelps' mistakenly saw the gay rights groups as supporting the pedophiles and began their train of thought down to homosexuality being the biggest cause of sin in the world.

They feel bad for homosexuals, they hate them in the sense that they believe they are going to hell, they do not promote violence (other then promoting going back to old testament law, though no vigilante violence).  A funny time with Shirley was when she was telling me about how all homosexuals (in her mind) participate in scat, and that they must hate themselves to do something like that.

Really 100-200 years ago their beliefs would have been perfectly acceptable.  Hell, it's much closer to what early Christianity was then what we see today.  Very much full of ideas of revenge and torment to the wicked.

What we are seeing here are not evil people, but broken people who are stuck in a time that's not compatible with ours.

Again, it's easy to just hate them right back and write them off as inhuman...this is rarely the case for anyone though.  Don't let your anger make you commit the same crimes you accuse them of.

Picture a street going north, crossing an east-west commuter train line (the detail is important) and butting into a east-west street. The time: when the nearby school just finished, and the streets are full of schoolkids, many of them going to the station to take their train home.

He eventually manages to head south; as the light turns green, I leave, but I notice that the crossing gates go down. So the asshole will be trapped by the train.

So I turn around, catch up with him, and as I start to give him shit, I notice a little boy on the seat.

The back of the train clears the crossing right at the time another train going the other direction arrives at the station, so the crossing gates stay down.

As I leave, the jerk decides to drive around the lowered crossing gates, only to fall in the hands of the railroad cop who was waiting on the other side of the tracks for precisely such an occation to give a $500 ticket to the asshole (maybe I should have asked the railroad for a commission)‚Ä¶

It's neat. Though to be honest, I don't find the song, in total, to be all that creepy.  The vocals definitely would be, but in my opinion, the guitar kind of takes away from the creepiness.  

it's not that the guitar is bad or anything.  It's that I believe the guitar could be creepier.  Perhaps if the whole song was at half speed and you kept everything else the same it would achieve this in my opinion.  The rhythmic characteristic of the riff you're playing, along with the speed at which you're playing it, makes it less creepy to me.

If I was imagining a mental image of an astronaut whose tether to the space station had broken and he's just floating about..facing away from the earth or the sun, there are some things i'd change about the guitar to make it creepier--- less focus on a rhythm..what if you just strummed ..., like in the beginning of radiohead's  Exit Music for a Film, for example from OK Computer  (if you haven't heard it, give it a listen...the album is one of my favorites too)

you can also think of the rhythms as having a time envelope ...perhaps it starts off non-rhyhtmic...but them over time increases...but then maybe it will decay rhyhtmically...like having a sense of increasing entropy

additionally, if you were set upon the tempo or the riff though, perhaps adding more reverb, or even preverb could make the guitar have the same level of air/quality that the vocals have.

t3_bkqj8,worldnews,1,0, bus ,"&gt;Prey tell me why the peace loving terror state feels its need to restrict toys, clothes, books, pencils, pasta and other goods going into Gaza?

Israel doesn't owe the Palestinians ANYTHING.  The Palestinians can get assistance from other Arab countries.  Israel isn't preventing Palestine from trading with the outside world, or receiving aid.  In fact, billions of dollars that were donated to the Palestinians ended up in Arafat's coffers.  

&gt;Why does the peace seeking state murder kids by shooting them if they get in range of the Gaza watch towers as they did this week?

Because why would anyone approach those locations if they didn't mean harm?  It is well known that some Palestinians extremists use their kids as suicide bombers.

&gt;Why does the peace seeking state try and derail the recent peace talks before they even got off the ground?

Past experience.  Every attempt to come up with peace has resulted in more attacks.  Israel gave the West Bank to them, and what happened?  There STILL isn't peace.  Hamas lobs bombs over the border into Israel.  Israel isn't looking for Peace, per se --- they simply want to be able to live without fear of being attacked.

&gt;Why does the most moral Army in the world use kids as human shields even after their leaders tell them not to?

Um, you are talking about the Palestinians, not the Israelis.  

&gt;Why did the terror state kill 400 kids in Gaza last year. Why did it deny medical aid to civilians it bombed for 2 days when it knew there were toddles clinging to the bodies of their mothers the Israeli peace loving state murdered in cold blood?

Because those ""kids"" were being used as human shields and enemy combatants.  When there is a war, does one side provide medical aid for the other?  Ever?  And if they did, what's to say that those kids weren't human-IEDs?  It's been done before.  Where was the medical assistance of other Arab countries?  In a war, kids die -- especially if they are being used as martyrs by their government.  

&gt;Why did the oh so peace seeking state drop a one ton bomb on a house full of women and kids, killing them, in order to target a single person?

More importantly, why did that one target hide amongst a house full of women and children, when he knew he was going to be bombed?  Did he care so little for the lives of those other souls?  Or did he (and some of them) realize that their deaths might act as a rallying point for others?

&gt;As for your being punched in the face, I'm sure you'd agree that you'd fight back with what means you had against a crewl enemy? This is the logic that got you bus bombs.

Israel never premeditatedly went after non-combatants, including children.  Suicide bombers, however, have no such qualms about the killing of innocent citizens.   

&gt;The Clinton 'deal': this involved this Pal. state having no rights over its airspace, allowing the IDF to operate at will anywhere inside it when ever they wanted it. Having Israeli roads crossing all over it. Israel keeping 25% of the West bank, with 'security' zones around it not included in the 25%. A disarmed state with no means to defend itself, no rights to its electro-magnetic spectrum. Some fucking deal.

I don't have the time to research this right now, but if this *is* correct, all I can say is that the Palestinians have declared that THEY WILL NOT REST until the entire state of Israel ceases to exist.  That being the case, of COURSE Israel would want to have security means in place to try to prevent more attacks against themselves.  

&gt;Your sick if you think the peace loving state wants anything but to get rid of the 'fucking Arabs'

Israel only wants to be allowed to exist, unthreatened by its neighbors.  That's all it's ever wanted.

&gt;I could go on, should I or is your mind closed to the evil that is the terror state of israel?

You are the close-minded one.

t3_blp5i,AskReddit,3,0, train ,"The charge is most likely misdemeanor but could be a summary don't know you're state laws, either one shouldn't affect getting a job but will most likely show.

As far as beating a charge I did after a cop also told me if I admitted holding he would let me go, I was walking on local train tracks. Then after finding less than a gram of marijuana after digging through my pockets the cop was exclaiming ""You're going down big time, buddy.""

After an ordeal where the police bragged about ordering pizza's and how they were going to party tonight they charged me with a disorderly. Which is about a $360 fine. At the local magistrate I attempted to explain the stop was bad and the judge simply said ""Yeah. Are you done? Uh yeah, Guilty.""

So I decided to fight it. At first I went to a public defender. The asshole told me that the disorderly was the cop being a good guy and that I was ""Buying the case."" They offered me ARD which is for an adult who gets their first DUI but it is offered to those charged with possession. At first I accepted ARD after some obvious warning from this judge, who repeatedly said that even though I signed the paper I still can fight the charge.

Simply ARD is designed for DUI and it results in an automatic suspended license and classes that end up with you not getting any record. But it costs around $2,5000 in total when all said and done.

So I still said fuck it and decided that a grand for a lawyer would be worth it. I get to the local courthouse and the stupid bitch DA tells my lawyer if I decide to fight the charges they will move to charge me with four additional charges that the cop claimed he could have done so.

After speaking with my lawyer she said although she wasn't sure she thought that there is a law against that. Plus after speaking with my father he noted that it could be double jeopardy because I was charged with Disorderly and found guilty and was appealing that and that's why I was there.

So after about five court dates four of which my case went unheard, finally the judge began to recognize me sitting there for almost 6 hours on four different days finally said to another bitch DA ""You have to deal with this gentlemen he has been sitting here a long time.""

When they heard my case my lawyer found the statute in our states law book that specifically is designed to stop what the young bitch DA did earlier. Here in Pa it is grounds for a dismissal if you are threatened with more charges after appealing one charge and the judge recognized this is clearly double jeopardy. Judge said show me original citation and if it read disorderly you're free to go. He basically laughed at how stupid the DA conducted themselves.

In the end I spent about $2,000 and all in all I could have saved much more and took the disorderly but on principle I still won, which is rare in these parts concerning home rule and the bullshit magistrate system we have.

But I have applied to jobs in which I have had a background check and they sometimes take longer than usual as the charges show up but the say they were dismissed. I'm sure it will likely cost me a ton of money to even try to change this.

Even though my case was peculiar and the stupidity of the DA is why I got off but I hope it helps. Bottom line whenever you're involved with the legal system; you encounter the most parasitic scum-leaching fucks known to mankind. Even when you win you will walk away losing something."

t3_blnhr,AskReddit,4,0, station ,"I have direct experience in doing this. I helped to emancipate my younger brother when we feared he was being physically abused by our alcoholic (now dead) father and neglected by his mom (my stepmother).

The situation was a little different in that I have two younger brothers who are 10 and 12 years younger than me, and we were only trying to remove the older one because the younger was clearly in no danger. That is complicated to explain, but it is true and we proved 100% right about it.

It's my understanding that time frames and process are very state-specific. This was in MA, and I don't know about NY and CT. I do know that to incite the process and get quick action, all you need to do is call the police and report that there is a child being abused, that you are a family member and are willing to take custody. From there they will arrest the parent and bring the children to the station where you go and get them. At this point DSS gets involved and it gets very legal-ish.

I was not trying for custody to myself - one of my uncles was the destination home. In our case, we emancipated my brother (he was 16), sent him back to the same town to live with a close friend whose mother was gracious enough to take him in, and my uncles and I have all chipped in to support him. For us this was the sensible solution - he was older, more self-sufficient, and had a good home to go to.

In general, the state and the government and DSS are all very flexible and child-safety focused. Getting health coverage for him was very easy (this was in '02) and getting some amount of financial aid required paperwork but wasn't too onerous. In general, all of the folks involved in the process are pretty focused in on the kid, and a lot of the support was immediate with follow-up paperwork. Hopefully this isn't just a Massachusetts thing - it was both necessary and helpful.

Couple points if it helps: 1) Enroll him in school immediately. The last thing a kid in that position needs is any more adversity or abnormality than what life has already dealt. Get him back into a peer group and feeling somewhat normal as soon as possible. 2) Get him into therapy, yourself into therapy, and the two of you into therapy together. This is for your own mental benefit and to satisfy any further inquiries by DSS in case the parents try to fight back. You should be able to get a lot of aid for this. Be sure and check a local multi-service center for more details. 3) Don't question yourself too hard. It's never comfortable to work with addicts, and they do a lot of blaming, questioning, and manipulation. Continue to remind yourself that no one would ever try to do this if it wasn't the only thing to do.

If you need any further specific advice or support, PM me anytime and I will do whatever I can. I am enormously sympathetic to your situation and well done for doing what you already have. Your brother is lucky to have you.

PS: I see that there are a lot of people asking to involve the kid in deciding. I think that is really well-intentioned but just absolutely dead wrong. It is advice from people who may not have lived in an alcoholic or abusive home or who don't understand how to deal appropriately with children from that background. You can ask him how he feels and you should, but please don't involve him in choosing what happens next. That is incredibly unfair to him. Bottom line: he is in danger. Get him out of danger and somewhere safe. On top of all the other shit he's had to deal with, don't make him feel responsible for what you're about to do to protect him.

* Carbo loading doesn't do anything.  Eat to provide enough calories for the day's training.  Don't shove 2 lbs of pasta down your throat because you think it will make you fly the next day.

* Don't starve yourself or restrict calories severely or anything like that.  This will make you feel weak and will be counter productive.

* Focus on recovery.  Nap if you can.  Recovery is a *huge* part of getting fast on a bike.  Distinguish between the two types of tired: tired because you had a long day at work vs. tired because you put in 4 days of hard training.  You train through the former, and rest for the latter.

* Have you been checked for possible medical causes to your tiredness?  Anemia is very common.  Hypothyroidism is less common but fits your symptoms.  Maybe a visit to the doc and some routine bloodwork is in order.

Keep on riding and try to have fun while you do it!  Don't make it a weight loss chore!"

t3_bl8k5,economy,1,0, train ,"&gt;Oh, I dunno. If nothing else, there are global energy companies with both the capital and technology to make bets on various emerging technologies -- both to extract traditional energy sources, and to invest in new ones.

So, sorta like how the train companies started up airlines?

Or how the phototypesetting companies were the ones who kicked off and drove desktop publishing?  And how the US Mail was a ""key"" player behind the invention of email?

Or how the big corporate newspapers were the main one's responsible for putting news &amp; opinion content online for free?

There are occasional exceptions (say IBM and PC's -- but that was only after they ""missed the boat"" with mini-computers), but in general business history shows us that big corporations don't like endangering current product lines and revenue streams by backing ""revolutionary"" (aka disruptive) competing technologies -- they tend to only back ""evolutionary"" changes, things that leverage and extend their current product line, asset base, and revenue stream.

Oh, the big companies tend to ""dabble in"" and ""play around"" with disruptive revolutionary new technologies &amp; ideas -- history is replete with examples of that (say Xerox with their PARC facility and the whole ""desktop computing"" &amp; networking systems; and AT&amp;T had the immense  ""Bell Labs"", but little was ""let out"" into the real world and most of its inventions were only implemented by other small startup companies) -- but they also tend to ""fumble"" the ball as the various ""political"" forces and vested interests WITHIN the companies themselves tend to quash the new tech.

One of the reasons for this is that product lines tend to be the MOST profitable towards the END of their life cycle (optimized systems are in place, infrastructure already exists &amp; merely needs to be maintained, etc.) -- and the LEAST profitable, often losing money in their early stages (entirely new infrastructure required, new ""problematic"" systems need to be created, have the bugs worked out, etc). So if the new product line goes after the same demographic or market base, it tends to be seen as a ""threat"" to the existing company rather than as an opportunity for future growth.

Personally, I also think this tends to be a ""human"" thing. Older people with established lives, belongings, assets, etc -- tend to *not* want to risk losing them on some ""grand adventure""; but conversely younger (or poorer) people, having little to lose are more likely to take the gamble; so is it really surprising that the leaders of larger corporations by definition tending to be amongst the ""older, established"" people are going to be less than fond of seeing everything turned ""upside down""? Instead they are more likely to expend efforts in maintaining and extending the current systems (*which is NOT necessarily a bad thing* -- if every oil company simply ceased drilling, refining, etc. then ""peak oil"" would arrive much sooner; and it might be much *more* difficult to implement any new technologies, or to revert systems and accommodate the loss of the existing ones -- after all, is it not wiser to maintain the house you are living in while building a new one than it is to let the existing place fall apart and have to live in a tent?)

But the problem with energy systems is one of EROI. Especially with transportation, we've ""progressively"" gone from less-dense, less-efficient forms of energy to more-dense, more-efficient forms (horses &amp; hay -- to wood &amp; then coal for steam -- and on to petrol &amp; diesel for IC &amp; turbine engines). 

And next up? Natural Gas? Hydrogen? Batteries? Each of them is (at least currently) a significantly LESS dense form of energy storage and transfer.  Natural Gas, while fairly abundant would not last very long if it were required to carry the ""full load"" of uses that oil currently serves. Hydrogen presents tremendous and unique problems; and batteries while hopeful, are nowhere near as efficient.

In short... we may simply be faced with a rather large ""paradigm shift"" -- one that goes AWAY from the current globalized world of ""personalized transport"" and the ""travel anywhere, anytime for any reason"" or ""buy anything FROM anywhere"" metaphor -- and which ""reverts"" back to a much more ""local"" lifestyle.

It could be ""progress"" depending upon how you view it -- much more likely to be small, local, ""multi-purpose"" factories with raw-materials transported (and/or recycled locally) rather than mass-produced crap shipped back and forth across the entire globe.

To me one of the models would be the ""Print-On-Demand"" one, where there is a local ""machine"" that prints a one-off (or small quantity) of a selected book from a digitally transferred (&amp; stored) library, requiring only the shipping of blank paper &amp; generic supplies that can be made into ANY book -- rather than printing excessive quantities (on ""spec"") and shipping tons of books to warehouse stores (of which well over half of the printed books end up being trashed/recycled).

All of which sounds fine for ""manufactured goods"" (and obviously the printing trade is already transitioning to entirely digital -- with ""paper"" only rarely needed).

But the problem comes in with FOOD.  You can send a picture of a ""banana"" in digital form -- but you cannot eat it.  And you can grow a small amount of ""extra/special"" food in your own garden or greenhouse, but you cannot grow enough to feed your entire family of four.

And likewise, the big farming systems that we have today -- well, no matter how many people you gather together, you cannot run a massive corn combine on human power. And you cannot grow, harvest, refine, package and transport the vast quantities of food that we need without tremendous expenditure of energy (for fertilizer AND machinery AND transport AND refrigeration, etc.) -- at least not to the extent necessary to ""carry"" the population that we currently have (much less the one we will likely have in a decade or two -- remember even 5% growth DOUBLES a population every 15 years).

Eventually, we're going to start hitting the limits of a finite world (if not within the next 15 years, then within the 15 following that -- as doubling is an exponential phenomenon -- and exponential systems *seem* to have plenty of ""room"" for growth, until **suddenly** they hit the limits, and they do it in what can only be called a ""dramatic"" fashion.)

*To my mind what it comes down to is that a ""blind faith"" in yet-to-be-created technology is the equivalent of ALL forms of ""blind faith"" -- believing that ""technology"" will arrive in a perfectly times manner to save us all is not only ignorant of history (when it came ...often far too late for countless millions of people), but is really NOT all that different in character than believing in ""rain dances"" or placing ""offerings"" before a carved statue (or whatever other similar practices that are normally derided by ""modern"" humans).*"

This can mean a number of different things depending on how you thought it out. In Texas for example, Austin is known to be widely liberal and San Antonio as a majority voted blue in the last presidential election as well.

I do have to agree with a number of people on here about how people threaten leaving the union but would back down from their threats. When it comes down to it, each state has something that it provides to the union and that the union makes up for that state's deficiency.

t3_bloit,WeAreTheMusicMakers,3,0, station ,"I don't normally endorse RIAA tactics for squeezing more money out of mechanical recording rights, but I think they have a point. Most countries require radio to pay mechanical royalties to the record companies, and Web radio already does here in the US. 

There is an argument that radio shouldn't have to pay mechanical royalties because of the valuable promotion they provide for record labels. This may be true for newer releases, but considering that radio stations today mostly play older catalog material (think of your local Classic Rock or JACK-type station), this is a much less convincing argument. 

The radio station that plays ""Stairway To Heaven"" for the millionth time is unlikely to result in another sale of Led Zeppelin 4, but a single from a newer artist is more likely to result in a sale of that album. Perhaps an exemption on mechanical royalties for newer releases (less than 1 or 2 years old) would persuade radio to play more new music, which would benefit both artists and labels.

t3_blik4,scifi,4,0, urban ,"I like both, but I find that there's more that I don't like in fantasy.

I guess my biggest complaint is that 90% of it is either:

1. Set against a backdrop of medieval European folklore, with dragons and other creatures borrowed from fairy tales.
2. Urban fantasy where vampires (themselves a product of European folklore) are real but somehow manage to keep it a secret. 

I don't know if it's that authors lack the imagination to adapt fantasy elements from other cultures, or if there's simply no market for other types of fantasy, but the lack of diversity is really annoying. I feel like I've read one fantasy novel, therefore I've read them all.

There's a lot of folklore from Native American, African, and Asian cultures which could be adapted for a fantasy story that wouldn't read like a Tolkien knock off, but that simply never happens, or at least it's not common to do so. Let alone seeing anything that's actually original.

(For an example of something more original, ReBoot was a kids show, but it used a computer as the basis of its fantasy setting. That's a million times more interesting than yet another novel with Kings and swords and wizards and orcs. But we never, ever see anything as creative as ReBoot in fantasy literature, why?)

Sci fi has its tropes as well - a lot of it is just a standard adventure story set in space with technology substituting for magic (especially in TV and movies).

A large area of land is under the USAF's landing/take-off approach to Luke AFB.  The agreement prevents the construction of new single family homes, which in my opinion, is great.  The west valley has a tremendous amount of homes, constructed, being constructed, and planned.  What we need is employment.  Hopefully, with the introduction of the F-35, the West Valley of the Phoenix metro can position itself to capture the ancillary benefits of the new fighter jet technology.  The noise will be something to contend with, but R&amp;D, manufacturing, logisitics, and other large-scale, non-residential uses could be perfect for these flight path areas.  These uses are net tax positive for the communities and will allow them to provide enhanced services to their residences.

If I could make a comparison, some communities impacted greatly by Luke AFB should take a lesson from Rosemont, IL.  In the shadow of a busy approach to O'hare airport, Rosemont has capitalized on hospitality, entertainment, industry, and other non-residential uses to support it's residential services.

Neither was Apple in the late 90s attempting to make something that opened up entirely unexplored avenues of possibility, but jockeying for position as a supplier for a part of the whole.

Mobile devices, and PCs before them, make the whole bigger. They expand the realm of possibility. Mobile devices are really only possible because of previous expansions of the realm of possibility, and they should serve as a further expansion. Apple's mobile devices, however, are making only very limited strides in that direction, due to explicit corporate decisions to limit that sort of thing.

t3_bl8k5,economy,1,0, train ,"Thanks for the long and thoughtful post.   Let's play: 

&gt;Oh, the big companies tend to ""dabble in"" and ""play around"" with disruptive revolutionary new technologies &amp; ideas -- history is replete with examples of that (say Xerox with their PARC facility and the whole ""desktop computing"" &amp; networking systems; and AT&amp;T had the immense ""Bell Labs"", but little was ""let out"" into the real world and most of its inventions were only implemented by other small startup companies) -- but they also tend to ""fumble"" the ball as the various ""political"" forces and vested interests WITHIN the companies themselves tend to quash the new tech.

My personal favorite is how SAP was originally  a research project of IBM's, that IBM decided to cut.  The project manager of that project went out, secured investors and a bank loan, and bought the project from IBM.  Does it really matter if the 'big train company' makes the airline, or some 'new company' composed in the ecosystem of people and technologies that it generates?  I don't think so. The CEOs of big companies don't put money into R&amp;D for grins -- they do it because they read history, and because a competitor with a leg up in technology stings them.  Whether they successfully adopt or not is irrelevant to the broader ecosystem that is the economy.    Once the tech exists, so long as there is consumer demand, someone will figure out a way to bring it to market.   Sure, lots of big companies fail to reinvent themselves or adapt to new technology.  But it would be more accurate to say that they aren't as *fast* at doing so, not that they don't do it at all.  

Take energy companies again.  I don't have the graph available, but it wasn't all that long ago that natural gas was considered pollution and was burned off of oil distillate.  The energy companies saw and developed natural gas as a separate sector, and it's been taking share from oil consistently ever since.  The graph that was interesting was Soviet shares of energy consumption -- each share (oil, coal, nuclear) was *exactly the same* as it had been in 1950, while the US and other countries distributions were wildly different.    The reason is that the western ones were flexible in response to supply, demand, cost of extracting, cost of generating, etc.   The Soviet system depended on bureaucratic politics. 

As to your energy density point -- I don't really see how it's relevant, actually.  Gas is less dense than oil.  But so what?  Using it involves that you trade off slightly less performance and have slightly larger fixed costs per unit -- but there are still fleets of natural gas powered taxi cabs, and it works well because gas is cheaper than oil.  It's simply a microecon tradeoff, not some macro econ paradeigm shifting thing. 

In fact the whole latter half of your post is predicated on there being absolutely no subsitutes for oil.  There are.  Just as one random example - the Nazis supplied half of the oil needed for their army and *all* of it's avgas using artificial oil, manufactured from coal and hydrogen.   In 1940.  Sure, it was uneconomic then, and it'll be uneconomic now until oil gets to $90 a barrel and stays there.  But $90 barrel oil isn't some civilization-destroying, paradeigm changing number.  

Moreover, any specific tech that you offer can be debated, just as all the others have been up until they failed for various reasons or someone made them succeed.  It isn't 'blind faith' to trust in human ingenuity when you look at history.  Going back to the Simon-Ehrlich wager, the two had been debating this sort of thing back and forth for years before making the wager.   One of the specific reasons why Ehrlich put copper in his basket of goods to rise was a debate between him and Simon over it.  Ehrlich was showing figures that population growth required x amont of copper for basic needs, and that copper reserves were declining, and there wasn't much more supply of copper in the ground.  Simon responded that if demand for copper rose too much, more copper or it's economic equiv would be created.  Ehrlich made much of this -- asking rhetorically if Simon thought they'd revive alchemy -- otherwise 'more copper can't just be created'.  Except it was -- the invention of pvc piping and fiberoptics, both economic equivalents of copper, led to crashes in the copper markets and made nonsense of Ehrlich's algorithms on the relationship of copper demand and population growth. 

Moreover, it wasn't just technological substitution at play that made all of the commodities Ehrlich picked drop in value.   For Chromium, for example, new techniques to pick up chromium nodules from the seafloor led to vastly expanded supply.  


I think what is hard to get for a lot of people about the 'cornucopians' is that it does sort of feel like 'blind faith' in humanity's creative powers.  but part of this a cross between the engineer mentality of wanting to have progress mapped out far into the future.  This can sorta work for projects lasting less than a decade, but over the longer term you simply don't know which technologies will pan out, which will be discovered that will make previous assumptions obsolete, and etc.  I think of it as the 'tech tree effect' -- there aren't any games that have a dynamic tech tree.  There are specific techs that you have to pass through in a certain order, at a certain cost.   Real tech development is not like that.  Or perhaps I should say the reality of tech development is much more complex than the model of the 'tech tree'.

How were ticket prices set?
The event ticket prices are set at a level to cover the costs of the event. Events of this magnitude, particularly in facilities not designed for major theater-style events, and those needing costly security and transportation accommodations to move 20,000 people safely through the process, carry very high costs.  His Holiness the Dalai Lama does not accept a speaking fee, and asks that ticket prices be set at a level which covers the costs of the events so that the host does not bear any financial burden for his visit.  Any funds raised through ticket sales and sponsorship packages, above and beyond the costs to produce the event, will go directly to the Emory-Tibet Partnership and the Emory-Tibet Science Initiative (through Emory College of Arts and Sciences) to further the work that the Dalai Lama is here to support.

when I was young, we had a gated community going up that ran out of money before it was done.

it was trippy, there was miles of sub urban roads, a few parking lots and a golf course with no clubhouse or paved path(they had dug the path already)

and there were 3 houses.

now before your mind starts to think any stereo types, we were a bunch of rich white kids.

It started off fun, I loved it. An entire house, far from hearing distance  of any civilization, you could party in.

I was annoyed when the cabinetry was destroyed. We had decent houses to play in.

but it didnt take long for various kids to raze the  the houses to the ground, litterly.

I was sad, they had ruined it.

so we stole a ton of wood that was left over and built a fort in the woods far from there. (no longer in that ghost gated community)

about ten years later, my home town is unrecognizable.
That ghost gated community is not a living gated community.
But the woods were still there were we built our drunk fort.

SO me and a bud went back there and scared the crap out of some highschool kids drinking in our fort. It was all covered in graphittee and looked well used over the years.


I was kinda glad that after all those years the drunk kids never burn it up or tore it down.

I just use an excel spreadsheet for my caloric intake. The online resources always feel a little slow and cumbersome to me. I tend to eat the same things every week so it makes it easy; I pretty much just copy and paste from previous days. 

I have to train by heart rate because I can't afford a power meter, so that's where Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR) comes in. There are a couple different ways to field test it that you can find on Google. I use that number to set different HR zones I want to stay in. 

Hill sprints are just 20 second full out sprints up a hill on my route with 5 minute recovery between. For the hill repeats I try to keep my HR around 105% LTHR for the 3 minutes (I accidentally typed 2x3', I meant 8x3') with 5 minute recovery between. ""Tempo"" intervals are around 88%-93% LTHR for 30 minutes with 10 minute recovery between.

So for example, the last time I tested my LTHR I got around 185. So when I do tempo intervals I try to keep my heart rate between 163 and 173. 

If you get the training bible you can make your own training plan to fit your needs. I do a lot of crits and shorter road races so my volume and intensity would be different than what you want to do. I would definitely suggest a heart rate monitor for training. "

As I Socialist I've spent quite some time addressing the misuse of the term and related concepts. While I laude the author for his attempt to clear up the matter, I'm afraid his conclusions are somewhat....lacking.

&gt;The first thing to point out is that socialism, communism, and Marxism are mutually exclusive.

No, they're not. Mutually exclusive means that the outcome of one particular system cannot exist while the other one does. Any Socialist or Communist society that coincides with the Marxian conception of Socialism/Communism would inherently contradict the notion of ""mutual exclusivity"" in this respect.

&gt;They're similar, but not identical or interchangeable concepts. In socialism, the government controls the production and distribution of goods, while citizens are free to own property.

The Socialist Left is an extremely diverse political that fosters a multitude of contrasting and often conflicting conceptions of an egalitarian society. While there is a particular brand of Socialism that fits the description you supplied above, there are also numerous other ones that are fundamentally different than your description.

&gt;Marxism is a little more complicated to explain, but reading up on it will reveal that it isn't so much an economic system as it is an economic philosophy.

No, no its not. Marxism was the early seeds of what would later become the field of Social Theory. Marx does not lay out the basis for alternative economics nor does he go to any particular length to explain how a communist/socialist society would actually work politically. Rather the vast majority of his work is devoted to analysizing the development of Capitalism and its relationship to society as a whole. Marx was one of the first philosophers to look deeply into social relations and bring together various disciplines to better understand how our world works in a uniquely social manner. It is precisely the lack of solid theory behind his work that has produced such wildly different ""marxist"" experiments. Marx never intended to have his work serve as the basis for a future society, rather he intended it to educate the masses to the point where they could design their own society. He believed that basic trends in history and the fundamental flaws in the Capitalist system would ""encourage"" the people to build a society that had certain traits. Socialism would be something that was created organically, not through the uniquely 20th ideological conflicts that were unfamiliar to people like Marx.

&gt;One argument I always raise against the socialism proposition is that of the police, which I discussed at length in a past article here.

This is by far one of the poorest counterarguments a person can make. The problem with the ""Barack Obama is a Socialist"" argument is not that it criticizes government action but rather that it proceeds along a false line of logic that has been reinforced by decades of cold war rhetoric. When you say ""Well the Police/Fire Department/Schools/Roads/Public Utilities are Socialist too!"" you're not disproving or rejecting your opponent's argument - quite the opposite. You are accepting their logic as totally valid and instead arguing that Socialism doesn't always result in bad things. By doing so you've fundamentally vindicated any misguided soul, as the argument has gone from ""is Barack Obama a Socialist?"" to ""is Obama a good socialist or a bad one?""

The solution to that argument is not fighting conservative ignorance with liberal ignorance. The solution is to genuinely understand what Socialism is and what Socialism is not. The police station is not Socialism. The fire department is not Socialism. The roads are not Socialism. A Single-Payer system is not Socialism. These things are nothing more than variants on the general principle of social welfare; that there are circumstances where a communial effort is more practical than an individual one. Since the beginnings of recorded history we can find examples of governments leving taxes for social projects and money being pooled together for public programs. To suggest that a society that embraces these things is essentially socialist is to basically render the term entirely meaningless. Welfare programs are exactly that - Welfare programs. They can be used by Fascist societies, Theocracies, Monarchies, Republics; in economies that centrally planned, market-based, Feudalistic, or slave-based.

t3_blppr,relationship_advice,4,0, train ,"Some can. Some people just can't sit and look at you while you're talking. Their mind requires more stimulation than a single person talking can provide. Almost every single time I ask my husband what I just said, he repeats it back to me. He has always been patient with my skepticism and never acted like I was being a bitch for not believing him. He understood that I'd need to see for myself.

I still ask him to turn and look at me sometimes (""hey babe, I need your attention""), usually when I have something important to talk about or when he hasn't been responsive. He can do this for a little bit, but if I try and get him to look at me for too long, his quick-thinking, stimulus-seeking brain starts occupying itself with other things. That's just the way he works. He's actually demonstrating more respect by doing what he needs to do to pay attention to me, rather than trying to make it *look* like he's paying attention when he's really not.

This issue is not a problem for my husband and me for a few reasons. The way *I* work is that I don't usually look at people when I'm talking to them, because it takes effort which derails my train of thought. So I don't usually care if he's looking at me or not. But most importantly, when I ask for his attention for a moment, he stops what he's doing and looks at me, thus demonstrating his respect for me by doing as I ask. In return, I make what I have to say as short as possible, to demonstrate my respect for him and his amazing (no sarcasm) mind.

If you want to try and work through this, you need to pinpoint the problem more precisely.

- Does he do this with his friends or just with you? If it's just with you, then he's probably not really interested in you mentally and that should be a dealbreaker.

- If you had proof that he really was listening, would it cease to bug you as much? If so, explain that, since it doesn't *look* like he's listening, you'll sometimes need to make sure he's listening by asking him to repeat what you said. Also explain that he can keep you from needing to do that by looking at you once in a while to demonstrate he's listening. If he protests, tell him that a relationship requires both people working on problems. You will try to accommodate him, but he has to do the same for you.

- If it would bother you even if he could repeat verbatim everything you've said for the last half hour, you'll need to take a different approach. Explain that whether he CAN or not is not the issue. The issue is that it's rude to engage in another activity when somebody is talking to you; it sends the message that you don't care about what they have to say. This should be your response whenever he says that he can do both at the same time: That's not the issue. The issue is it's rude to appear to ignore people even if you're not. ""Casual"" doesn't enter into it: just because he *can* doesn't mean it's not rude.

    You will still need to compromise in this case, of course (only fair, since he will be changing his behavior for you). You will have to recognize that his brain requires the extra stimulation and he will not be able to focus as well when he's trying to look like he's paying attention to you.

Don't be afraid to use words like ""ignore"" (as in ""it sends the message that you're ignoring me""), ""rude"", and ""disrespectful"". Generally, geeks appreciate directness and honesty over diplomacy, and usually, being brutally honest and direct is the only way you're going to get your point across anyway."

Don't think that everybodies orifice has to be engaged simultaneously. It's alright to let the girls play for a while. It's alright to shag one girl while the other watches. It's okay to let yourself be pampered by two mouths without doing anything yourself.
Porno threesomes always feature everyone getting sucked and fucked in unison but it just doesn't work that way in real life. Three is an awkward number for simultaneous pleasuring. So relax, let things happen, and don't stress if you don't get any action for ten minutes, or the girls aren't having synchronised orgasms. You have the whole night, so take your time and focus on one task at a time. Everyone will get there in the end.

Also, for the love of god, bring many bottles of water. Whoever gets sandwiched in the middle when you fall asleep will wake up sweating like a pig and bone-dry. I've found it pretty common to get a threesome-hangover from dehydration.

t3_blqzu,Fitness,0,0, train ,"&gt;Pre-emptive apologies, I'm going to be blunt; I Hate the word 'stablizers'.

It's more descriptive than technical, but the term does serve a purpose. 

&gt;What exactly are we talking about here, transverse abdominus? Internal obliques? Intercostals and/or Serratus? All these muscles are what people refer to as core 'stabilizers', and are trained extensively during weight training. (Possible exception to obliques, as rotation or a resistance to rotation is needed, and not advised for most lifts for safety reasons).

Different muscles act to stabilize other muscles during certain situations. The term is fluid. 

&gt;The reason there is no carry-over from weights to baseball is because they are completely two different things. Your muscles do not need to be regrown or rewired in any way, you just need to practise the movements and specific motor patterns. This is neurological in nature, not physiological.

It's both. The swing of a bat requires a very specific set of muscles doing very specific things. While, yes, this is neurologically commanded, using certain muscles with certain other muscles physically helps those muscles work together better. Certainly there's no arguing with that. As great as, say, an ab bench with weights is, it won't necessarily mean overall stronger abdominals under certain circumstances. Yoga and pilates programs (at least the good ones) include a very wide variety of movements which seek to train all core muscles in many different combinations in order to result in the best overall functionality. "
t3_bl6pz,science,3,0, station ,"&gt;Mir was one space station, with its own objectives and goals and research projects.

Mir was a cold-war relic of a dying empire.  However, it was bought, paid for, and **in orbit.** It didn't require $150bln to create.  Mir was actually killed to justify spending money on the ISS.

&gt;Let me put it this way, would you mock the price of the LHC and question why the scientists at the Tevatron, which is designed with different purposes in mind, cannot do all that the LHC can?

No, because if you're doing microgravity research, the only fucking thing you need is zero G.  John Glenn did microgravity research on Friendship Fucking Seven.  An atom smasher is something that changes dramatically as computational and metallurgical technology advances.  The fact that you think an analogy can be drawn here shows how little you understand about basic science.

Another reason I wouldn't make that argument is it isn't the argument I'm making.  The argument I'm making is that the ISS helped kill the SSC.  

&gt;These are not isolated examples. New research facilities are expensive, and growing perpetually more expensive as we design for different, more complex criteria.

Ayup.  And my family and close friends helped design, build and manage the following complex projects:

 - CERN
 - The Very Large Array
 - LIGO
 - The Thirty Meter Telescope

&gt;Neither of us are qualified to question the engineering of the LHC or the Tevatron,

Neither of us are questioning this.  Only one of us is questioning whether or not the ISS has justified its expense via science.  The other knows better: [""In 2002, a US National Academy of Sciences report described the station as a waste of money that would ""never achieve the status of a world-class research laboratory"".](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2010/mar/28/cern-particle-physics-space-antimatter)

&gt;and I highly doubt you're qualified to determine whether the SSC verus the LHC, or either compared to the ISS will provide a greater impact in their respective areas of research.

And there, [you're mistaken.](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bl6pz/today_i_learned_that_ronald_reagan_wanted_to_have/c0nbcno)  Seriously [mistaken.](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bl6pz/today_i_learned_that_ronald_reagan_wanted_to_have/c0nbyq3)

&gt;To that end, I'm not going to be brought into a childish discussion of the relative merits of one project or another, 

You're sixteen hours late to be making this decision.

&gt;I'm not qualified,

I said this sixteen hours ago.

&gt;and neither are you.

Again, you are gravely mistaken.

&gt;I can say unequivocally that the ISS has done a lot of research and a lot more research than you're willing to admit.

You can either be ""not qualified"" or you can ""say unequivocally."" You can't do both.  PROTIP: go with ""not qualified.""

&gt;I think it's entirely shortsighted of you to reject one project as less valuable or important than some other scientific project.

You've made that abundantly clear.  You've also made it abundantly clear that you think the ISS is a science project, so it wouldn't surprise me if you also believe in leprechauns.

&gt;So let's drop it.

I'll bet if I check your history, I'll discover that this invitation to ""drop it"" is the longest thing you've written on Reddit.

&gt;But to say that the science ""could just have been done on the Mir"" as a layman is disingenuous.

You assume I'm a layman.

&gt;Perhaps Mir was not able to eventually support all the modules the ISS has?

Perhaps all space stations are boondoggles that have fuckall to do with science?  If we want to do ""microgravity research"" it can be done hella cheaper than, you guessed it, a hundred and fifty billion fucking dollars.

&gt;Or perhaps... there are a million ""perhaps,"" and neither of us is qualified to say one way or the other.

Perhaps you should stop assuming that just because you don't understand what ""science"" is doesn't mean the rest of us are equally incredulous.

- Always have one of [these](http://coolrain44.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/purell-hand-sanitizer.jpg). I found it very useful.

- Regardng the places you shouldn't miss: it depends on the countries you are planning to visit. I went to Blois, Toulouse, Paris, Orleans, Bruges, Brussels, Amsterdam... and a couple more cities I can't remember right now. If you're planning on going to any of those countries (France, Belgium, Holland) be sure to visit the places I mentioned.

- When you get to a city, if you have a hostel booked, go there first and leave your stuff. If not, leave it in the luggage lockers you'll find in every train station and rent bikes. Every major city has bike rentals next to the trains stations and the city itself has a bike lane. It's a fast and fun(and cheap) way to see the city.

I was fortunate enough to train with a couple guys from the Yamakasi in Brighton a while back. It was brilliant, they gave me such perspective on everything we do. They told us of the show-offs in Paris doing to impress girls, and the increased likelihood of the injuries they get, and they made me tremble with fear at the size of them perfectly-honed bodies.

This footage for me underscores exactly what is wrong with parkour in the media. Obviously the 'true' nature of parkour doesn't get enough limelight because let's face it, drilling a cat pass for an hour does not good TV make. 'Crazy', 'extreme' stuff like this and Bell's Man Power gap do.

To people who are maybe just discovering parkour, or are even slightly interested, please read a little into it before you tell someone else what you think parkour is. I hate to sound snobby and elitist but if you watch the mass-media you are probably not quite clear on what exactly parkour is. Watch the interviews with David Belle on youtube, watch videos by people like Blane, Stephane Vigroux, maybe the Cambridge parkour lot. Parkour is not doing flips and spinz'n'shit and looking fancy, it is pure, efficient movement. It is conditioning your body to move here to there as if your life depended on it. To be fair, David Belle does a pretty good job of showing its true nature in District 13.

As for people who seem to think it's dangerous; it's only dangerous if you attempt stuff your body isn't ready for. The people you see doing parkour (or freerunning for that matter) on TV have often been practising for years and the danger aspect, while not 0, is substantially reduced.

Does he need to be killed? Does it matter what he thinks? Why not leave him alone? Why waste money taking him down? Seriously...  Why not ask his mom?

I didn't intend to suggest there are two different kinds of muscles, but there are different ways that one can train muscles for different results. And extreme example would be someone as lean as Bruce Lee being able to bench press 500 lbs. As reps. He was extremely lean, seemingly having substantially less muscle mass than, say a linebacker that would struggle to lift the same. Lee, like many, many others, trained specifically in order to have the most efficient muscles. 

[Bruce Lee image](http://mike.files.wordpress.com/2006/10/bruce-lee.jpg). Even if he had a larger frame, he would still have been very lean and yet extremely strong. 

&gt;PROVE IT. 

If you did a session of pilates (an actuall session, with a live teacher and not just some informercial DVD), you'd know that it's a fundamental part of pilates to train the whole core in as many ways as possible in on session. Also, calm down. Getting emotional doesn't serve any purpose.

[This is an extreme example](http://www.chrisdickerson.net/photos/BeachPose.jpg). Remember that in most bodybuilding competitions, the contestants are retracting their diaphragm in order to make their core look more lean and chest/back seem larger. "

t3_bkhwv,AskReddit,1,0, train ,"I posted this comment a few weeks ago in response to a similar question. I'm re-posting it here in case it would help your friend:

I'm a chef myself (15 yrs in the trade). The best thing I can recommend is NOT to spend much money on the school side of things and focus on getting into the cook apprenticeship program at a local trade school. When you get out into the industry, the only thing people seem to look for is trade papers and a good attitude. Most apprenticeship programs divide time between class work and industry apprenticeship. Here in Canada the apprenticeship consists of 2 yrs part-time school combined with 6,000 hrs of work under a journeyman cook. When you complete school and the 6,000 hrs you write an exam and get your 'Red Seal' which means you are a journeyman cook and can train apprentices. I have worked in the UK and France (and here in Canada) and everyone asks for trade papers. So hook up with whatever is the government recognized trade school in your country. Maybe the only time you would need to rely on going to a good school is if you are applying to a really pretentious restaurant where the chef went to some overpriced school and is looking for the same. I have to say - I have met some total fucktards from the CIA in my life.

If you choose to apprentice, don't go to a really weird type of restaurant (like molecular gastronomy or something) because none of your skills will be transferable to a normal kitchen. As a cook you will go through dozens of chefs in your life and they way to impress them is by having enough skills to come in their kitchen and work along side everyone else without much supervision.

oh - one other thing - if you apprentice you are allowed to fuck up. Whenever you make mistakes people will just blame it on being an apprentice - and they are more open to sharing their cooking secrets with you cuz they know you need to learn. If you come from some big name school no one will tell you shit cuz they expect you to know already. There is way more pressure to be perfect (and way more people standing around laughing when you fuck up).

Hope this helps. Best of luck with everything.

PS: If you are looking for a career with lots of potential for growth - world travel - good pay/benefits - structured apprenticeship programs - apply to a large, high-end hotel chain (Fairmont, Royal Meridien etc.)

http://forums.mtbr.com/showpost.php?p=5970450&amp;postcount=1

I have a Polar HRM, it's really nice, the computer interface is clunky, right now if I had to buy again I'd get one of the nicer garmin units.  The gps and ability to upload ride tracks is pretty swank, and it records a lot of data and I think integrates with the powertap hubs using the ANT wireless system (something to think about if you decide at some point to start tracking power for training).  

Slykens gives you tons of great advice.  One thing I'd like to add: if you start doing hill repeats and sprints before you've built up your base fitness / mileage, you're going to trash yourself out real fast and be overtrained again/more.  So I guess what I'm saying is take his advice, get the book, but don't do exactly what he's talking about here because he's probably got a lot more miles in his legs.  Friel's book explains all this in great detail.  I made the mistake of trying to train to hard to early once.  It just made me crazy tired.  

Another thought, in another post you said one of your goals is to not sag.  If you're riding with guys who are in better shape than you, you might be inadvertently doing workouts harder than your fitness level allows for right now.  One of the horrible things about riding with friends is it ends to put you into the grey zone for effort/heart rate.

Although geographic expansion slowed considerably and eventually halted, political and economic assimilation continued well into the 3rd and 4th centuries.

Your point about dilution is well-taken, although I would also suggest that as early as 40 BC they were experiencing widespread religious and social crises that would lead towards the reestablishment of local rule, fragmented loyalties, etc., which in the west lay the foundation for feudal rule while in the populated urban centers set up the grounds for a return to increasingly independent city-states.  It's much less linear than you suggest, I think.

Since you're here, I should ask - why does this map show such a simplified version of the boundaries?

Most of them avoid humans studiously, and onlyscavenge from humans when they are in distress, and need to steal an easy meal.

I have a garden and chickens, so I have to protect my food.  I harass the raccoons, and they leave me alone.  

Most humans are oblivious to them, and if you become the one human who notices them and tosses rocks, they go bother your neighbors.  A BB gun is actually a very appropriate tool for this.  If you watch at dawn, you can often catch one climbing a tree to go to sleep.  A BB gun pumped once or twice has almost no chance of breaking the skin, but scares the heck out of a treed raccoon.  Then I tell them firmly to stay out of my territory, and piss on the tree.

This policy allows me to grow food twenty feet from a creek the raccoons regularly use.  Although it causes the animals a few moments of fear, it prevents them from becoming habituated to taking food from humans.  In the long run, this protects them from encounters with dogs, cars, and traps, as well as poison set out for rats."

I never use the word nigger, nigga, negro, or the ""n-word"" for a number of reasons. First, it doesn't fit into my vocabulary. I'm no professional dude, but i could find a lot of other words to describe a black person or african american then the words previously mentioned. That is, if i even need to point out that the person is black. Second, When I hear words that make me feel uncomfortable, I don't even bother listening anymore. I don't want that happening to me. Therefore, i avoid confrontational words. If someone needs to use that word then they aren't worth listening to, especially if they're a lawyer.
You can tell a lot about someone by listening to their choice of words. 

I'm also a little annoyed at the double standard we have with language. Black people can say the ""n-word"" but white people can't? By doing so the word is put on a pedestal, making it more attractive. This applies to other races and ""their words"" as well. White people don't get angry at the word cracker, nor do they lay claim to the word. And subsequently you don't see it being used as a derogatory word. I'm not trying to save the world here, it's just a point. 

If you haven't noticed, i refer to african americans as either black or african american. It's what *I'am* comfortable with, because *i* don't care what race you are. I only recognize two races- asshole and not asshole. If you're not an asshole i like you, and if you're an asshole i don't like you. Simple as that.

The best advice i could give you when hearing someone use nigger, nigga, negro, or any other variation of the n-word is to just tell yourself that he or she is not worth listening to; that his or her words are worth exactly two cents. It's a word unlike every other that is based on so much hate, anyone who doesn't recognize it as such is a retard.

I don't know how it is where you both are, but here in NZ, most schools have adventure playgrounds - padded/barkchip floors are great places to start learning.  Basic vaults can be practiced over low walls, and you can practice rolling out of a fall from short heights, and then work up to higher surfaces, combining it with vaulting over obstacles, too.

Also, to keep yourself from getting into that 'busted up' situation, learn to fall first, and never train when you're tired.  Parkour isn't about being able to do the biggest leap and survive, it's about finding your own limits, and knowing when it's safe to push them.  

My mistake was trying to go 10 foot onto concrete, at 3am, with no sleep.  While I was coming down, my eyes got that itchy feeling, and just closed.  I couldn't spot the ground, and just froze - Ended up taking the full force of the drop on my legs, without rolling, or even being able to cushion it by compressing my legs.  I walked away with a sore ass, but woke up the next morning to find both ankles were swollen up like balloons.

But, I'm getting back in.  I realise that I'm overweight and undertrained to do the things I used to, which brings me back to my previous point - it's about being the best you can do, not about being the best.  If you're uncertain about whether or not you can make a gap, don't try it.  Find a flat piece of ground, measure out a similar distance, and prove to yourself you can consistently clear that distance.  Then get back up, and try it at height, but only once you're certain - the easiest way to fail is to be spooked as you come up to the ledge, slow down as you change your mind, then attempt to clear it at the lower speed.  Recipe for disaster.

This is where the [cat leap](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;oi=video_result&amp;cad=5512385241564597683&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CAgQtwIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTH_tK9yQTbM&amp;ei=8gi3S4TLOIj4sgPQivzoDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGP-TftbuYtt3Iyfnrd3QJjsU9WtA&amp;sig2=gG3jmvXMn8bXKppSapOFBA) comes in.  This will save your life, so practice the crap out of it.  Make sure you can pull yourself up onto a flat ledge before attempting this at height.

And seeing as we're both firmly at the bottom of the thread, I'll pass on some other bits of advice, though they're not really related to your original question.

Don't ever worry that you can't do the amazing things you see the kids doing.  Parkour isn't about being the best - it's only about being the best you can.  This is especially important to remember when you're first starting out - people are going to make things look easier than they are, but you shouldn't attempt anything you're not confident you can do.

Whenever I've trained people up from scratch, I've watched them get cocky, and planted their face into the ground almost right off the bat, and almost always on simple things.  When you come to your first vault, climb over first.  Practice hopping one leg onto it.  Practice hopping both legs onto it.  Practice hopping over, resting your legs on the way.  Practice hopping right over.

Learn how your body feels while you do all of these, because it's important that you're conscious of how strong a jump you need to make, or how pushing with your arms affects how you move over.  It's simply about learning how your body can move.  This is how you'll move onto bigger things, because you'll *know* you can jump x feet across, y feet down.

Sorry.  I realise I must sound like I'm talking down to you a bit, and I don't mean to - these are just the things that concern me the most when people take up Parkour - they're the things that injure the ones who're actually keen.

On a side note, if you find a group of younger people training, ask if you can join them.  Explain the situation, and ask if they'd be willing to help you through some of the basics - suggesting places to practice simple vaults, and so on.  More than likely, they'll be happy to have someone show a real interest in what they're doing, rather than the usual 'look at those crazy people' that traceurs tend to have to put up with.

Worst comes to worst, they tell you to get bent, and you just find somewhere else.

Also, some of [this](http://www.ehow.com/search.aspx?s=parkour&amp;Options=0&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) stuff might be useful, though I haven't had a good look at it.  There used to be a group called 'screwgravity' that had a particularly good set of tutorials, including animated gifs and whatnot from all sorts of angles that were *perfect* for learning from, but they sadly seem defunct, now.  I remember one redditor saying they had something to do with them, though.  I'll see if I can find him and pressure him about it again.

Last bit of advice.  Have fun.  If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong, I'll tell you that.  Parkour is all about finding the most efficient route.  Parkour training is all about trying new things to see how they work, and is one long learning experience.  You'll love it, I know."
t3_bl3kf,science,27,0, transit ,"&gt; The words I used were light beams(plural is your first hint). Do you seriously not construe that to flux? I did not say light particle. It is not my fault you insist on being wrong.

How shall I address your perfect ignorance? This is what you said:

&gt; The real case is that these light beams are traveling countless light years slowly undergoing entropy

IT IS FALSE. Photons do not experience entropy while in transit. What is true for one photon is true for a billion photons. The reason is that entropy is a time-related phenomenon, and photons do not experience time. This falsification applies to all your comments that describe photons in transit -- they are all false.

* Contrary to your claim, individual photons do not experience entropy, and no photons experience entropy while in transit.

* Contrary to your claim, the inverse square law has nothing to do with entropy.

* Contrary to your claim, optical dispersion has nothing to do with entropy.

* Contrary to your claim, EM radiation in and of itself is not entropy.

* Contrary to your claim, photons never deviate from the speed of light, nor do they ever experience time.

&gt; Laser from 1 inch away burns paper, from 10 feet feels warm(maybe), and from 100 feet feels like nothing. This is an increase in the disorder, and increase in randomness as photons 'interfere' with each other and spread according to inverse square decay.

This is *perfect nonsense.* If it were true, one could reverse entropy with an optical system that focused light:

* [A laser beam is dispersed with a system of lenses (click for example)](http://vps.arachnoid.com/temp/optical_example.png), so that it has a radius of a meter as it crosses a laboratory. According to your ignorant belief and your earlier remarks, this wide dispersion means the entropy of the light has increased.

* At the other side of the laboratory, a different set of lenses reconcentrates the light to a small beam capable of igniting paper. This reversal is accomplished without any additional energy into the system, which, if your theory were correct, would violate the most basic requirement for entropy (it cannot decrease in a closed system), *except that you are wrong.*

*You very simple do not understand entropy*. You think a reduction in energy level equals an increase in entropy, but this is false -- there is no change in the energy level for a closed system, one in which entropy is certainly in effect.

You think a dispersed light beam represents an increase in entropy, but you are wrong. The reason? A light-beam dispersal can be exactly reversed with no loss of energy or extra energy requirement, and entropy doesn't work that way.

Also, and more important, entropy is not time-symmetrical, but optical phenomena are (and must be). This is not to say that entropy doesn't affect optical phenomena, but your claim about beam dispersal is perfect nonsense.

Before you embarrass yourself further, when you imagine a physical experiment, ask yourself if it is time-symmetrical. If it is, then it is not an example of entropy (this is not to suggest that all non-time-symmetrical phenomena are entropic).

* Open a bottle of perfume. The perfume fills the room with a very high probability. The likelihood that the perfume will spontaneously reassemble in the bottle is very, very small. This is not time-symmetrical, and it is an example of entropy.

* Disperse a laser beam so it covers a wall. Can that dispersed beam be reconcentrated with no loss of energy? Yes -- [as in this example](http://vps.arachnoid.com/temp/optical_example.png). Is it time-symmetrical? Yes. *It is not entropy.*

The same principle applies to all time-symmetrical phenomena and phenomena that do not experience time (i.e. all electromagnetic phenomena while in transit) -- they are not examples of entropy.

&gt; It is not my fault you insist on being wrong.

My opinion (you should probably ignore this): Most of their policies involve tweaking numbers and not fundamental change.

Probably most interesting is their stances on ""fair"" wages, guaranteed pensions, GM food, electoral reform, and education/immigration.

Liberals: fight urbanization (mostly by creating agriculture jobs), review health and environmental impact of industrial practices, national childcare plan, national seniorcare plan, encourage employment and subsidize training into old age, eliminate poverty domestically and abroad (especially child poverty), national power grid, subsidize alternative energy, subsidize infrastructure development (especially public transit and water treatment), subsidize domestic agriculture, ""encourage"" profit-sharing with employees, broaden national health care to contain ""long-term care, mental health, dental and vision care"", affordable housing (including subsidizing development of low-income housing, which I think is a much better solution than the rent subsidies being thrown around), reverse ban on homosexuals donating blood, ""implement a carbon tax, a cap and trade system, or a combination of both"", loosening business regulations, encouraging ""rational exploitation of natural resources"" and ""secondary and tertiary resource processing in the resource areas"", national water policy, recognizing foreign credentials, public transit.

My opinion (you should probably ignore this): The liberals are a bit weird because individual candidates/MPs can vary so wildly in their platforms. The parties biggest issues are probably water (access to clean water, no bulk water export, cleaning large bodies of water, etc), public transit, infrastructure spending, expanding health care (dental, vision, long-term care), affordable housing, and subsidizing re-training of older Canadians (and encouraging working into old age). Their platform is all about long-term sustainability. I was actually surprised and impressed when I read this, but I also re-emphasize that individual MP/candidates can have wildly divergent views.

I might do the other parties later. This took me a surprising amount of time. If you want to educate yourself about the working of parliament, consider subscribing to [the parliament of Canada subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/CanP40S3/)"

&gt;When I was 16 (1995) I drove a piece of shit 2 door 1972 Toyota Corolla that wouldn't start without 1/4 can of starter fluid and a push, and it often shook and died without warning... City streets or highway, it didn't care... The driver's seat was broken as well, and was held in the upright position with a few stolen plastic milk crates from behind the grocery store... Anyhow, I loved and hated that little car is my point...

&gt;One day I was driving with a friend and was stuck behind an old lady who slammed her brakes on when the light turned yellow. I had to slam my brakes hard to avoid hitting her... This killed the engine PLUS toppled over the milk cartons that were holding my seat upright...

&gt;(Have any of you tried to sit up straight and drive with the driver's seat completely reclined into the back seat? It's harder than you'd think...) Anyhow, my friend and I are laughing, and she's trying to help me lift the seat back up before the light turns green, and then we hear the train warning and the gates are coming down behind us... We are directly on the tracks....

&gt;The light turns green to clear the intersection, and the lady in front of me takes off, but I can't start my car! My stomach muscles are aching from trying to sit up against the collapsed seat, and I'm actually holding myself up on the steering wheel more than anything. I put my foot on the clutch, hoping we will coast, but we're straddling the slope and are at a complete stop. Luckily, it was nearing a bend in the tracks and was fairly close to a train-stop, so the train wasn't SPEEDING, but it was still going fast enough to kill us if it hit I'm sure...

&gt;My friend starts crying and gets out of the car and tells me to do the same. I went to open my door and then I saw the train coming towards me in the distance... I didn't PANIC, and I don't think I was paralyzed with fear or anything, but I sorta froze for a second... It was just surreal...

&gt;I put my car in neutral and tried to start it again. I have no idea why, but letting the car get hit just ""seemed"" not to be an option.

&gt;CRASH Suddenly I'm flat on my back looking up at the ceiling of my car, my friend is knocking on my window sobbing and then I hear the train screaming it's whistle and passing behind me.... Once it passes a whole bunch of mexicans run towards the car to make sure we are ok... I'm totally confused...

&gt;The Mexicans in very broken english tell me to ""go. go now. police."" and they all pile back in their truck and take off...

&gt;I was now past the slope of the tracks and able to coast my car to a start. My friend gets in the car and I take her home... We're both laughing, because really, what else do you do after something like that?

&gt;She told me what happened: The truck full of gardeners behind us saw our predicament and slammed into the back of me to push me off the tracks after yelling at her to get out of the way... They were heros, but were too worried to entangle with the police to stick around... :(

&gt;ANYHOW. I really wish there were cameras everywhere back then. That would have been a super-cool viral video I'm sure.

&gt;Also, I've been dying to tell this story since I rented Hancock last week. That scene made me happy, and now I'm trying to remember whatever happened to Theresa and that little car... And, of course, the Mexicans... Did karma ever repay them for me? Did they get caught and get in trouble for the damaged guard rail? (It didn't break, but it closed funny for a good year or so)...

t3_bkqj8,worldnews,1,0, bus ,"&gt;&gt;    Prey tell me why the peace loving terror state feels its need to restrict toys, clothes, books, pencils, pasta and other goods going into Gaza?

&gt;&gt; Israel doesn't owe the Palestinians ANYTHING. The Palestinians can get assistance from other Arab countries. Israel isn't preventing Palestine from trading with the outside world, or receiving aid. In fact, billions of dollars that were donated to the Palestinians ended up in Arafat's coffers.

Israel is the occupier.  International law places certain responsibilities on you.  If you don't owe them anything why let anything into the strip?  You decided to place the Gaza strip under a siege. Do you deny that you patrol the borders and sea and shoot at anyone trying to leave?  If you are not trying to collectively punish these people why stop them leaving by sea?  Now answer the question, **why the peace loving terror state feels its need to restrict toys, clothes, books, pencils, pasta and other goods going into Gaza?**

&gt;&gt;    Why does the peace seeking state murder kids by shooting them if they get in range of the Gaza watch towers as they did this week?

&gt;&gt; Because why would anyone approach those locations if they didn't mean harm? It is well known that some Palestinians extremists use their kids as suicide bombers.
Because ts their land and they have a right to be there? These are kids and kids will be kids. Is it necessary to kill them?  Is there no other way than to kill them? Now answer the question, ** Why does the peace seeking state murder kids **


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    Why does the peace seeking state try and derail the recent peace talks before they even got off the ground?

&gt;&gt; Past experience. Every attempt to come up with peace has resulted in more attacks. Israel gave the West Bank to them, and what happened? There STILL isn't peace. Hamas lobs bombs over the border into Israel. Israel isn't looking for Peace, per se --- they simply want to be able to live without fear of being attacked.

You did not give anyone the west bank.  If you did whey are there 300,000 + thieves still there? As for Gaza you placed it under collective punishment as soon as Hamas was elected.  You tried to derail peace talks.  Why? Do you not w3ant peace?  What is the alternative to peace talks?  No answer the question, ** Why does the peace seeking state try and derail the recent peace talks before they even got off the ground? **


&gt;&gt;    Why does the most moral Army in the world use kids as human shields even after their leaders tell them not to?

&gt;&gt; Um, you are talking about the Palestinians, not the Israelis.
You're obviously an amateur on Israeli tactics.  Google Cast Lead, IDF, Human shields and see the two sub-human shits who used ** a TEN year old boy ** to open bags they thought might contain bombs.  For fucks sake, you must really have dehumanised these people to even THINK that is acceptable.



&gt;&gt;    Why did the terror state kill 400 kids in Gaza last year. Why did it deny medical aid to civilians it bombed for 2 days when it knew there were toddles clinging to the bodies of their mothers the Israeli peace loving state murdered in cold blood?

&gt;&gt; Because those ""kids"" were being used as human shields and enemy combatants. When there is a war, does one side provide medical aid for the other? Ever? And if they did, what's to say that those kids weren't human-IEDs? It's been done before. Where was the medical assistance of other Arab countries? In a war, kids die -- especially if they are being used as martyrs by their government.

There is no independent verification that Hamas used kids as human shields.  We only have the glorious moral IDF telling us that.  And they have again and again been caught out.  You treat these kids as canon fodder.  You're sick.


&gt;&gt;    Why did the oh so peace seeking state drop a one ton bomb on a house full of women and kids, killing them, in order to target a single person?

&gt;&gt; More importantly, why did that one target hide amongst a house full of women and children, when he knew he was going to be bombed? Did he care so little for the lives of those other souls? Or did he (and some of them) realize that their deaths might act as a rallying point for others?

 Even more importantly, answer the question.  The terror state knew there would be this mans family and extended family sleeping in his house with him.  Are you seriously saying that this man should have known (how?) he was going to be a victim of a terrorist assination by the terror state?  You dropped a one ton bomb on this man and his family in a heavily populated residential part of town knowing you would murder civilians.  A clear calculated decision to kill civilians. 


&gt;&gt;    As for your being punched in the face, I'm sure you'd agree that you'd fight back with what means you had against a crewl enemy? This is the logic that got you bus bombs.

&gt;&gt; Israel never premeditatedly went after non-combatants, including children. Suicide bombers, however, have no such qualms about the killing of innocent citizens.

This is blatantly untrue.  I invite you to study the disciplinary record of one Mr Sharon.


&gt;&gt;    The Clinton 'deal': this involved this Pal. state having no rights over its airspace, allowing the IDF to operate at will anywhere inside it when ever they wanted it. Having Israeli roads crossing all over it. Israel keeping 25% of the West bank, with 'security' zones around it not included in the 25%. A disarmed state with no means to defend itself, no rights to its electro-magnetic spectrum. Some fucking deal.

&gt;&gt; I don't have the time to research this right now, but if this is correct, all I can say is that the Palestinians have declared that THEY WILL NOT REST until the entire state of Israel ceases to exist. That being the case, of COURSE Israel would want to have security means in place to try to prevent more attacks against themselves.

You are presented a fact about Israel you know nothing about and immediately you support it.  I think you would blindly support anything done in the name of Israel. Honestly do you think anyone would accept a state where they were ruled by another one who has a history of violence and terror like Israel has?  You don't want peace.



&gt;&gt;    Your sick if you think the peace loving state wants anything but to get rid of the 'fucking Arabs'

&gt;&gt; Israel only wants to be allowed to exist, unthreatened by its neighbors. That's all it's ever wanted.
Not true.  You want land.  You want the 'greater israel'.  You don't want the Arabs.  This was evident in they way your founding fathers (AKA terrorists) ethnically cleansed the Arabs from what became israel.  Or do you think that didn't happen either?


&gt;&gt;    I could go on, should I or is your mind closed to the evil that is the terror state of israel?

&gt;&gt; You are the close-minded one.

I read, I visit, I see for my own eyes,I speak to people and I come to a opinion based on fact.  My mind is open which is why I tell it how it is.

I condemn any killing. No ifs, no buts.  You justify the slaughter of kids.  You a sad sick person supporting a terrorist country.  Shame on you,

&gt; Then again, speed is a relative thing: the train object (available inside the source package, in the ""3D-Objects"" folder) was rendered at a meager 6fps on my Athlon XP, back in 2003. Around 2005, however, my Pentium4 desktop at work took this up to 11 fps. As of 2007, by way of Intel's Threading Building Blocks (or OpenMP) the code uses both cores of my Core2Duo to run at 23fps... And since it uses TBB/OpenMP, it will automatically make use of any additional cores... so give the CPUs a few more years... :-)

&gt; Update, November 2009: On a 4-core AMD Phenom at 3.2GHz, the train now spins at 80 frames per second... Guess I proved my point :-)

So in 6 years you get a 8x speedup using CPUs. [In the same time GPUs had a performance speedup of 25x](http://www.ixbt.com/video3/images/cuda/gflops.png) while adding a gazillion new features... not to mention that even from the beginning GPUs already had much better performance than any software solution -- unsurprisingly since that's what they are designed for. Your software solution doesn't even appear to support texturing, which is particularly inefficient to support in software.

In summary, I'm glad you enjoyed writing it, but **insinuating that software rasterization is getting closer to the performance of GPUs is completely incorrect.**

t3_blgr6,technology,-2,0, train ,"&gt; There does not exist one reason that benefits you as a **costumer**

Now you're just being _theatrical_. teee heeee mofo.

You seem to want to imply malice in the fact that there is a specific set of features.

It is clear (but nobody really pushes this point) that the device is extreme iCentric - you can pull most pay content from iTunes and iBooks (or is it iBookstore?).

It supports html5, video and audio, so I don't know if that opens the gates for others to sell / give audio offline to iPad users. Perhaps, if anything, that is something that is consciously developed.

But, to say the device is positioned not to cut into sales of other lines of products (if that is also what you are saying) so what? I think a company has the right to position products with clear market goals.

Was not adding a camera a way of defending macbook market share? Perhaps. This is the one thing that always confused me.

Can I step back and still judge the device _on its own merits, separate from every other product in the apple line_? Yes.

You don't seem to be able to.

If you were hoping I am some idiotic apple fanboy, you are wrong.

I am intensely supportive, and critical, of android. The same with iPhone, I've ranted about iPhone. Is it still the best phone? Yes. Are phones and communication an important part of my ilfe? Yes.

I found at least 30 ways I'd improve the Phone part of the iPhone. From being able to find out durations and quickly finding out if a text message preceded a phone call or not, to allowing sms confirmations. I am an expert user of phones. I develop PBX systems. I develop GSM integration apps and mobile application suites for businesses.

I've developed for many mobile platforms, I carry three phones, I have several other DIDs and various utility lines that I use to screen calls and make my life easier.

I like apple because they made my life a fuckton of firkins / fortnight easier.

I think the crux of this is, you believe that are crippling the device. They believe that are delivering a device for functionality X. You want a device for functionality XY, so you assume a device for functionality X is crippled.

Again, I am saying, I am as confused as you are, and I know the reasoning, as to why adding a camera to the iPad would result in a 3% drop in macbook sales, imagine.

But, you also cannot begrudge a company for releasing a product that does X, only X, and does X fucking well, because you want Y.

Fuck me. Look at kindle, because one thing, you could have called me a kindle fanboy, but look at it:

It is blocky, darker grey text on dark grey. Not black on white eink. Darker grey on dark grey. The contrast is fucking non-existent.

It doesn't even have a built in reading light (I am serious!) So you need to illuminate it the old fashioned way (follow my train of thought here).

So where is the fulfillment of the promise of an ebook reader? There IS NONE. There is also NO CAMERA on the kindle. Where are you criticizing amazon for that?

The iPad is.... \***HOLY SHOCK HORROR OF FUCK**\* a MEDIA device. An eBook reader. An eZine reader. A blog reader. A reddit fucker. A fruit fucking comic book raping lickable screen of sex.

It is like the first time you cum in your girlfriends eye, and you fall in love with her when she is winking at you, squinting one eye, smiling, with some cum on her chin.

OK, it isn't really like that and I don't know where that came from. But you get the point.

I'd ejaculate over my iPad, and I know you would too. But don't. It's my fucking iPad.

t3_blspr,AskReddit,3,0, train ,"I'm a licensed rider, have been for 18 years on the street and another decade before that in the dirt.

People who think loud pipes save lives should really invest in an upgraded horn instead. Stock motorcycle horns give off an anemic little ""beep!"" that belongs on a toy, not a vehicle on a public road. Stebel makes an air horn for motorcycles that can scare a car drifting across lanes back into paying attention pretty much instantly. Odd how the ""Saves Lives!"" crew never thought of that.

That said, both my wife and I have termi's on our Ducatis, and they're louder than stock. Not nearly as loud as a Harley with straight pipes and the baffles removed, but probably a good 20% loud than stock. I'm definitely not the in ""Saves Lives!"" camp though -- safety means full safety gear, the best quality we can afford, and proper training to back it up. For me it's purely because of aural appreciation ... the sound of an Italian Ducati though Termignoni pipes and with the mechanical complexity to the sounds of the desmodromic valve train and 90-degree L-twin engine is exactly the sound that I feel in love with back in '93, which the Ducati 916 was the cover of Cycle World and Carl Fogarty started doing some amazing things at tracks around the world. Not agricultural pushrods on this V-twin! Youtube has a good video documentary at i6K2CUdqURg, though note those are full race bikes so the noise is a lot louder than what I'm talking about.

Think of it as someone with a vintage Stratocaster guitar played through a Fender Bassman amp ... they get a real pleasure out of playing Red House or whatever they're favourite rock/blues tune is up near where the amp starts to distort beautifully. The ones that make good neighbours are thoughtful and polite about it. There's no noise at night, they'll help re-paint the shared fence when it's time, there's no unnecessary revving/whatever the rock equivalent is, and they're always willing to do some house-sitting for you when you go on vacation. That's because good neighbours are good neighbours, while asshats are asshats. What about this has anything to do with motorcycles?

I can't help but think that the real cause for the anger is that the general public has a fear of motorcycles, which the media has reinforced since before James Dean took to the screen. No one seems to mind the sound of the diesel trucks that seem to be everywhere (I live in oil patch country) because they're seen as desirable rather than scary. Same thing with the folk festival music that goes on every summer (on 3 stages simultaneously until the early morning) a half-block from from where I live. Desirable rather than scary. The next time a bike with loud (yet still reasonable) bike goes by you, with the rider in full safety gear and behaving respectfully, it's worth considering whether any anger you feel is misplaced."

Product placement, role models, reciprocity... not all advertising is equally pernicious. You can't avoid product placement if you ever watch video of any kind, and I'm willing to make that tradeoff. It's hard to be completely against advertising of any kind, since anything that informs you as to the existence or attributes of a product is, by definition, advertising. Even if you never saw any ads out in the world, if you go into a store, the *products themselves* are advertisements for themselves! Unless you never, ever need to buy anything, you're going to be subjected to advertising in some form.

But I think we can make a huge dent in the effect of advertising by getting rid of or avoiding video and audio ads. Still images have less impact, as do product placement and reciprocity. The best way to combat the role-model type of advertising is probably to teach kids about how it works, and hope they work out for themselves that it's fakery put on by giant corporations.

In fact, that's the real question. Given that we probably can't ban advertising, what's the best way to train ourselves to combat it?"

This stat is from where? There's way too many people making minimum wage to say that seriously.

&gt; Walmart pays their door greeters more than minimum wage meaning they didn't need a law to recognize that job is worth more than the law minimums.

You do realize they get no benefits right? No dental or medical.

I didn't want to go into the actual math (because I'm lazy), but here you go:

Minimum wage ($7.25 federal wage x 40 hours wk x 4 weeks) = $1160 month (this is without tax, which doesn't actually happen)

* Rent= $500 month
* Utilities= $150 (electricity, water, gas, etc.)
* Food= $180 a month (assume $45 a week x 4 weeks, which is pretty low. Some people live in apartments in a city and can't grow their own food.)

You net $330 a month (again, without tax)

This assumes no car payments + car insurance (or transportation budget of any type), no medical expenses (hope you don't get sick or have a preexisting condition; office visits alone are $100 w/out insurance), and no dental coverage (hope you floss). This also assumes that people aren't allowed to make a savings account for retirement.

[Wikipedia says:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlements#Types_of_localities)

&gt;Isolated outposts and/or unauthorized residential outposts, might be ""wildcat"" outposts consisting of campers, trailers, and even tents and sometimes have progressed to have some permanent public and/or private structures. Most of these settlements are the results of settlement and construction since 2000 and no new villages have been authorized. Though most settlements started out as such, the term is usually used to describe newly constructed developments since 1996 or March 2001 are largely on hilltops, at some distance from Arab communities, which are typically found in valleys.[44]  Many of the unauthorized outposts were and are in fact established , subsidized, and maintained by various ministries of the Israeli government. Ariel Sharon's administration commissioned the Sasson report, which found several government ministries cooperated to ""systematically establish illegal settlement points"", paying millions of dollars to create the infrastructure for scores of settlements.

[Peace now says:](http://www.peacenow.org.il/site/en/peace.asp?pi=62&amp;docid=2175)

&gt;However, very early on the settlement movement also took on a distinctly economic aspect. Successive Israeli governments (led by both Labor and Likud) heavily subsidized the settlements, for various reasons. These reasons included political considerations, such as appeasing the settlement movement‚Äôs leaders and playing to the right-wing national-religious camp inside Israel. They also included ideological reasons, bearing in mind the commitment of many Israeli leaders and politicians (from both Labor and Likud) to holding onto key areas of the West Bank, including areas with historical resonance for Israel (such as the Etzion bloc) and areas once considered strategically important for Israel‚Äôs security (like the Jordan Valley, locations along main transit routes, and areas of high elevation).
With an insufficient number of Israelis to populate all of these areas drawn to the West Bank (and until recently, Gaza) for purely ideological reasons, successive Israeli government undertook policies intended to motivate a broader part of the Israeli public to move to the occupied territories. In doing so, Israel created a class of settlers who were drawn to the West Bank primarily for economic reasons -- better housing at comparatively cheaper prices than could be found inside Israel, tax breaks, subsidies on transportation and education, etc.

t3_blyl4,energy,3,0, rail ,"It's only part of the reason hydrogen won't make it.

Hydrogen *does* have lower energy density than methane.  It's the carbon oxidation energy and density differences.  As compressed gas, you need substantial larger volumes (think several more rail tankers or truck tankers) for the same available consumable energy output.  Even as liquid, methane still comes out a head in Joules/m^3 or Joules/kg.

The bigger issue is hydrogen must be created and distributed.  For that the infrastructure is virtually nonexistent.

For methane you get it out of the ground or as a byproduct from petroleum or coal processing or from biomass.  These are existent infrastructure or designed processes, man-made or natural, already.  Hydrogen has no infrastructure for creation, distribution and storage.  There are no natural processes that can be tapped in volume leaving only man-made processes, which are energy intensive.

The creation of hydrogen either comes from hydrocarbons (most industrial hydrogen today comes from this source *and creates CO2* as a byproduct) or it comes from electrolysis of water.  

The challenge of the latter is that you have a fairly high activation energy input requirement in addition to the actual bond energy storage input.  Activation energy inputs usually are unrecoverable - they turn into heat.  Pretty much every electrolysis enhancing technology involves inventing a catalyst that can reduce this activation energy so that less energy input is required that is necessarily wasted.

The distribution and storage are a special problem for hydrogen.  Being the smallest molecule, it is the hardest to build seals for.  Pipes need seals.  Flanges to storage tanks need seals.  Transfer couplings to cars need seals.

And you *must* have very good seals with hydrogen because it is akin to freon (chlorofluorocarbons) in terms of destroying the ozone layer.  If you leak hydrogen from your distribution in quantity you are basically doing the equivalent of re-introducing ozone unfriendly freons.

NASA has had almost 50 years of dealing with hydrogen in gas and liquid form. The result of that is technology that *can* seal hydrogen *moderately well* but **never** perfectly.  This technology is more expensive than what is used for hydrocarbon fuels.  And when you scale out this technology to a national level, the costs go through the roof and the leakage of ozone destroying hydrogen become quite significant.

The costs (due to process energy inputs and sealing technology) reduce the EROI and financial ROI of hydrogen substantially.  But even if you had all the money you needed (talk to entrepreneurs these days and ask if VC money for new technologies and their deployment is easy these days, however), there is the simply financial and logistic challenges of building a national infrastructure from scratch.

First, the US hasn't really created anything that grandiose since the Eisenhower administration (1950s) and the highway system.  Few of the engineers and managers who had that knowledge are still live today.  

Further, just like water has an activation energy that must be added in addition to the bond energy, so too you must add capital investment that won't ultimately be part of the productive system you are targeting as goal. That's a very hard sell, especially in the current economic climate.  

These barriers basically mean there is no path from point A (today) to point Z (hydrogen nirvana) partly because there is no points B, C, D, E, F, etc. at the very beginning of the journey in place to make a partial transition. 

This situation is highly analogous to the engineering dilemma of the [IPv4 to IPv6 transition](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ipv6mess.html).  It is simply so new and different that not enough existing infrastructure is leverageable to ease the transition.  

The common thread of every successful technology transition in history has been leverage of existing technology infrastructure. Building out everything from scratch rarely works.  It's not a feasible engineering strategy."

t3_blw03,lost,9,0, station ,"Oceanic Flight 815 did hit severe turbulence on its way to LA from Australia but did not crash, one of its passengers though, Jack Shepherd, had hit his head and entered a trauma based coma. And the following events for the past few years have all been in his head. The crashing of the air plane was an subliminal effort to create a world in which he is needed, a world were he is in control of his own life.

The other survivors are created visually from people he had seen or communicated on the plane, their back stories and connections are made up creating an aura that fate has brought them all together, giving him the idea that everything is happening for a reason, no matter if he wants to accept that at first or not.

* Sawyer represents the side of Jack that wants to be free, with out the control of his father, or his pressure to be a doctor.

* Kate represents the perfect girl in his mind, strong willed yet at times in need of his help. Because he built up this version of Kate he feels he is too weak to make any attempt at becoming something more together, even with Kate's advances. Thus why she tends to swing back and forth between Sawyer and Jack, between what Jack wants to be (and thus who creates the closest connects with Kate) and what he is.

* His father: While not being able to fully cope with the loss of his father in Australia he circumvents this problem by having Christian simply disappear from the island. Subtly tricking himself into thinking his father is still alive.

* Locke: While not being able to cope with his dead father, and still not being able to cope without a father at all he turns Locke into a father figure. He basically transplants the ideas he has of his real father and places them into Locke. Thus his confidence, and his attempts to guide Jack in a direction he doesn't want to follow. Later, as Locke and Jacks paths grow farther and farther away he starts to slip Christian back into the picture, making it seem like he has been behind the scenes the whole time.

* Hurley: Jack in his purest form. Hurley represents Jack as a child, his wide eyed optimistic views of a better time in his life.

* The Others: Before this world he created became to strong, the mere effort of leaving the Island would destroy this world and in doing so would kill real-jack. So he creates this group of people, The Others, a group of people who seem to have lived on the island for years and who fight to keep the survivors from leaving as well.

* Smoke Monster represents his fears, not just any fear, but the fear of his looming death. Every person on the island is scared of the Smoke Monster because it is the end of Jacks life and thus the end of the Island and everyone on it. If the Smoke Monster succeeds in his plans everyone will simply cease to exist and Jack finally dies.

* Jacob: Being a man of science Jack needs a rational reason for his world, and the simple way to solve this problem is with Jacob. A mysterious being who has a plan and seems to know everything. He is also in direct competition with the Smoke Monster, he is fighting to keep the Island there and thus keep Jack alive.

Directly after the crash, where Jack finds himself alone, thrown from the Plane yet uninjured, he places himself immediately into the saviour role. Rushing onto the beach he finds everyone in some sort of trouble and immediately starts to fix everything. Shortly after every turns to Jack for guidance and leadership, as a Doctor his whole life this is where he is most comfortable but wanting to be free he tries fight it every step of the way. 

The Smoke Monster is more active in the earlier shows and slowly backs off in the later episodes and seasons (till the end of season 5 and all of season 6). This is because early on he is simply unconscious on an air plane with little to no medical help (an ironic moment when one the stewardess yell if there is a doctor on the plane), and so the threat of death is most active till the plane lands and they get real-jack to the hospital.

While Jack may want to leave the island and return to his normal life, subconsciously he knows that can't happen and so he enlists Locke in the role of creating reasons to stay on the island, so he discovers a Hatch. Locke spends every waking moment trying open the hatch, without really knowing why and when he starts to fail he loses his legs and thus he starts to disappear all together. Once he finally opens the hatch what does he find? A button. A button that has to be pushed every 108 minutes or the world is destroyed. 

The hatch itself is an internal struggle between Jack's wanting to leave the island (Unknown to him such an act would mean death to real-jack) and his subconscious trying to prevent just that. Once the issue is resolved an his subconscious becomes the victor the Hatch is opened and Jack is now tasked with the constant pushing of a button, a sloppy hastily made device to keep him on the island. 

The raft is another similar conflict between Jack's desire to leave and his necessity to stay. Necessity takes form of Walt as he burned the raft simply because he didn't want to leave, but Desire continues and builds another raft this time with more help and they launch. The only way to stop this is to take The Others, an entity created out of Necessity to stay on the island, and attack the raft, burn it and kidnap Walt to prevent the creation of another raft.

The creation the swan station came with a problem for Jack's subconscious, if this button had been here the whole time, who had been pushing it before? So he has to create a new character, Desmond. But using up all the people he had seen on the plane Jack has to pull him from somewhere so his memory of a fellow runner he had met in the past takes the form of Desmond. At first it seemed all he needed was to show someone was there and have him leave so one of Jack's characters would have to take his place. As Jack began to question these events, Desmond is forced to return and a back story as to how the jogger got to the island is created. 

This shows the first in many steps that as Jack becomes stronger in this world, the world itself become more immersive. 

As the years pass by, the desire to leave becomes so strong it kills the only original character charged with keeping him on the island, which is when the threat of death embodies himself in Locke in order to directly convince Jack to leave and thus kill himself. As his subconscious becomes more and more divided so do the characters he has created on this island, team Jacob being the Necessity to stay on the island and survive and team MiB being the Desire to leave."

I went twice a week for four hours and it was the greatest experience of my life.  The most menial thing I had to do was cut/edit/paste audio recordings and file them in the network database.  It was a sweet gig since I got to go, set up and record the symphonies and ballets in town for free and watch them from the catwalk or pits.

Anyway, the hardest thing I had to do was a mock edit with the head audio engineer behind me acting as the Symphonic conductor [Hans Graf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Graf) and going through the recording and having to splice out 16th-32th notes with others of the same note/timber and splice them in.  He's yelling at me, telling me this note is wrong, that note is wrong, why the hell is it taking is so long.  I was going mad with the pressure.  After all the face-yelling and shit being thrown around he told me this is what Hans Graf does to him after every performance.  He really put me out to the dogs so to speak.  The internship ended with me being the head audio engineer for a live performance inside the radio station's studio being aired live with my name being given as Lead Audio Engineer over the air.  I left with a burned copy of the session that I set up and engineered and a lifetime of experience in radio.  

My classmate?  He worked at a recording studio building bass cabinets.  He never even got to touch the console.  "
t3_bm18e,Parenting,1,0, train ,"You need to train her to put herself to sleep instead of getting her asleep in your arms then putting her down. 3 months is old enough to do this. The technique is [Ferberization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferber_method) and it doesn't mean you simply let them cry until they give up. You let her cry for 5 minutes, go in, pick her up calm her down.. As soon as she's calm, you put her down again. Then wait 10 minutes and do the same thing, then 15 minutes.. and then repeat at 15 minutes.

This is the technique we used with our oldest who had been a terrible sleeper and within a week, he was putting himself to sleep. It has the added benefit that it trains them to be able to fall asleep without needing to be cuddled, so it helps with night time wake-ups which become less about a requirement to eat and more about a need for attention as time goes on. At 3 months, nighttime wakeups are still going to require feeding, but this technique is fine for daytime napping.

The hardest part is listening to the crying. It's gut wrenching, but if you can get through it, you'll see results pretty quickly. It literally changed our lives when we were at our absolute wits end."

t3_blyfg,AskReddit,1,0, bus ,"My tooth (#30) crumbled but I didn't go to the dentist because I had neither dentist nor money. Soon afterward I got a job, but the job didn't provide health insurance right away. Weeks later the tooth got infected and I suffered terribly. My face swelled up on one side. A friend counseled me to get treatment at a local dental school. I had money then so I could afford it. The student dentist gave me a root canal, but then the faculty saw my condition and arranged for me to have the tooth extracted at the local public hospital. I rode a free shuttle bus from the university campus to the hospital. I spent 11 days in the hospital. The tooth was extracted under general anesthesia. The bill was $13,000. I lost a tooth, was permanently scarred, and US taxpayers paid the bill.

I learned my lesson, so when the equivalent tooth (#19) on the other side of my mouth crumbled, I got it fixed right away.

Oh, wait: I have another story. I tore ligaments in my knee. The knee swelled up a lot and I couldn't walk. When I recovered enough to limp using a cane, I took a bus to the local public hospital. I was directed to a cavernous waiting room where I waited with many other people... I think for about an hour and a half. Then I was directed to a department upstairs, where I waited. Then I was ushered into an examination room, where I undressed and waited. Eventually a doctor examined my knee and told me they needed radiographs. Back to a waiting room. Finally the nurse gave me an appointment to have x-rays taken... in July. This was March. 

Days later I receive a bill for $110. For less than five minutes with a doctor, no diagnosis, no treatment, no prescription, nothing except ""We'll need to take x-rays."" I didn't pay the bill. The county sued me. I went to court and explained that I was told I'd have to wait more than four months to get x-rayed. The defense lawyer told the judge, ""Oh, that can't possible be true."" The judge said, ""I can't believe they'd make you wait that long."" Unfortunately I didn't get the appointment in writing; I had just walked out in disgust. Also I didn't think of asking the judge to call the hospital and make an appointment to get x-rayed. Judge ruled against me. The State extracted the $110 from my tax refund. Since I was completely broke at the time, I went hungry for a while. My knee ligaments are still torn; I've never had any treatment for them. Weight training has stabilized the knee quite a bit, though, so I'm happy about that."
t3_blubh,pics,1,0, train ,"I hiked Mount Fuji last summer and it was an amazing experience. I started at 4:45 PM and got down at around 7:00 AM the next day and did a continuous hike throughout the night without sleeping. Surprisingly the hike wasn't the hardest part, it was getting to the top at midnight only to arrive in what seemed like a ghost town because everyone in the lodges were fast asleep. I ended up trying to sleep on the ground with only my backpack as my pillow which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't for the fastest winds I've ever seen that would find any access to my skin and freeze and bug the fuck out of me. I eventually had enough of that after 20 minutes and found a door with a crack of light coming through and went inside and found a washroom. I spent 4 hours in there freezing my ass off just waiting for that damn sunrise to get its ass up but in the end it was worth it and the view was amazing.

 It's insane to see only a couple people going up at night and no one at the top and then 4 hours later see a whole train of people walking up the mountain. Going down was actually awesome because every time you take a step the cinder below you slides beneath your feet so for each step you get an extra couple feet down the mountain and you can even get a fast pace going. I got lucky because both days up there were perfectly clear and apparently you can only see the top of Mount Fuji from the base 50 days of the year.

Unpaid internships are win-win because business owner gets cheaper labor while the intern gets experience."
t3_blzst,reddit.com,7,0, urban ,"Thing is that it is *not* just a matter of the sheer volume of food produced. (In that, I would agree that organic {in it's original sense} can definitely be more productive -- though it does not ""scale"" as readily and has a significantly higher labor component.)

The current system is the one that allows a HUGE population of urban people (by which I mean urban/suburban/exurban) the ""eloi"" to exist living hundreds and thousands of miles distant from the sources of, the smells of, and the work involved in producing their food (and thus non-paradoxically it is one major reason *why* they are almost entirely ignorant of the methods used to produce it all).

The thing is that -- whether you want to say it is an ""induced"" or ""indoctrinated"" or even ""brainwashed"" thing -- **the urban public is (and in general *prefers* to be) disconnected from food;** this is evident in multiple ways:

* the urban public has come to expect ""perfect/plastic"" food -- Apple's are expected to be spotless, large and to resemble the almost cartoon-like image of an  ""ideal"" (And the same with virtually everything else, whether Green Peppers, Carrots, Tomatoes, Cabbage, or ears of Sweet Corn, etc.)

* the above demand for a faux ""ideal"" is often seen -- even at farmer's markets -- vendors that bring ""dirty"", ""speckled"" or ""misshapen"" fruits and vegetables quickly learn that they will be taking most of their product back home with them.  (I have personally seen this even when the food is offered on a ""free"" basis.)

* the urban public wants to eat anything AND everything year-round -- they expect *every* restaurant to offer a ""salad"" (lettuce tomatoes, etc) every single day of the year, without exception; likewise, they seem to expect that their local grocer carry the entire array of food at approximately the same price throughout the year (anyone *raising* prices in off-season is seen as ""gouging"" and ""greedy"" and ""exploiting"").

* the above reaches to the ridiculous -- perhaps most notable within the ""vegan"" and ""vegetarian"" crowds\*\* -- there seems to be an utter disdain for any and all ""canned"" foods and the pickling (eww... SALT) and other methods necessary for preservation (you see, that makes them ""highly processed"" foods) and as a result everything is expected to be ""fresh"". (\*\* Yes there *is* a sub-sect of the ""organic"" movement that is pushing the ""eat local -- eat SEASONAL"" but the general public still wants what it wants... and that means salads and fresh raw veg in February.)

* and then there is the (ironic) whole ""disdain"" for meat and the love of tofu and ""soy-based"" faux meat (I mean you want to complain about ""chemical"" food, about ""processed"" food? And you eat TOFU &amp; SOY-burgers??? Seriously! I mean we're talking about a bevvy of salts, acids, enzymes and a host of other ""ingredients"" {you know, ""gypsum"" -- the stuff they make drywall out of} in order to coagulate this into a pseudo-food that only humans could possibly be convinced to eat. I mean [even dogs don't like it](http://www.ehow.com/how_2222746_dogs-eat-tofu.html) and considering what dogs DO eat, that's pretty telling. {Than again, tofu *was* invented in China, and heaven knows they will eat just about anything and everything there, as long as it moves or grows... than again, they pretty much have to.})

IMO, if you want to live in an air-conditioned urban box, travel around in another air-conditioned box, in order to work in yet another air-conditioned high-rise box as a passive ""consuming"" member of the matrix-bound mass-rabble, pushing papers and digits around on glowing screens, so you can pursue rather inane and pointless ""entertainments"" (can you say ""WOW"" and ""Whee"" ...or I meant ""Wii""); *and then making ""demands"" on a nanny-state via legislative fiat as part of a ""majority"" mob* -- well, you really shouldn't be shocked then that the self-same ""nanny-state"" builds and maintains a system (which is them ""gamed"" by the top players) that keeps you in blissful ignorance about what the working ""morlocks"" are producing for you to eat... quite frankly, you pretty much ""asked"" for it, demanded it (via legislation) and voted for it (with your dollars).

The operating speed is usually 30 km/hr to 35 km/hr higher than the posting speed... The main reason for controlling speed is to minimize the variation of speeds on your high speed facilities. 

Another reason to control speeds is in areas with a high pedestrian volume. In such cases, we usually de-synchronize traffic lights, to prevent speeds from increasing 30 - 40 km/hr.

The big threat to safety is a big variance in speed.  20 years ago roads were designed for wet conditions. Right now roads are getting designed for a drunk driver driving on a stormy dark night. Thus the factors of safety increase which means the roads might be actually under posted in terms of speed.

Finally, People drive at speeds they're comfortable driving at. if we find  that 80% (key percentage in transportation) of drivers are operating at the speeds then perhaps we should consider increasing the speed limit; however, the counter argument is that an inconsistent speed limited highway leads to a higher collision rates due to confusion.

Safety is a big factor, but speed variance is bigger!"

Well yeah, because paranoidly railing against something when they've got no ideas for how to replace it is kind of misguided.

You *choose* what corporate products to consume, and you *choose* to accept a mentality and lifestyle that drives consumption.  I take the middle path: I buy the things that I actually need and that actually constitute substantial improvements to my life, while not buying the things I don't need and the things that don't really make me happy.

Moreover, this state intervention is not limited to just social welfare provision. Hong Kong has an affordable public transport system in which the government has substantial equity in most transport systems and grants franchises and monopolized routes. So as well as being the monopoly owner of land and the largest landlord, the state imposes rent controls, operates three railways and regulates transport services and public utilities as monopoly franchises. It subsidies education, health care, welfare and charity. It has also took over the ownership and management of several banks in the 1980s to prevent a general bank run. Overall, since the 1960s *""the Hong Kong government's involvement in everyday life has increases steadily and now reaches into many vital areas of socio-economic development.""* [Ming K Chan, *""The Legacy of the British Administration of Hong Kong: A View from Hong Kong,""* pp. 567-582, The China Quarterly, no. 151, p. 575 and p. 574] It also intervened massively in the stock market during the 1997 Asian crisis. Strangely, Friedman failed to note any of these developments nor point to the lack of competition in many areas of the domestic economy and the high returns given to competition-free utility companies. 

The state did not agree to these welfare measures by choice, as they were originally forced upon it by fears of social unrest, first by waves of migrants fleeing from China and then by the need to portray itself as something more than an uncaring colonial regime. However, the other form of intervention it pursued was by choice, namely the collusion between the state and business elites. As one expert notes, the *""executive-led 'administrative non-party' state was heavily influenced by the business community""* with *""the composition of various government advisory boards, committees and the three councils""* reflecting this as *""business interests had an overwhelming voice in the consultation machinery (about 70% of the total membership).""* This is accurately described as a *""bureaucratic-cum-corporatist state""* with *""the interests of government and the private sector dominating those of the community.""* Overall, *""the government and private sector share common interests and have close links.""* [Mae Kam Ng, *""Political Economy and Urban Planning,""* Progress in Planning, P. Diamond and B. H. Massan (eds.), vol. 51, Part 1, p. 11 and p. 84] Sizable fortunes will be made when there are interlocking arrangements between the local oligarchies and the state. 

Another commentator notes that the myth of Hong Kong's laissez-faire regime *""has been disproved in academic debates more than a decade ago""* and points to *""the hypocrisy of laissez-faire colonialism""* which is marked by *""a government which is actively involved, fully engaged and often interventionist, whether by design or necessity.""* He notes that *""the most damaging legacy [of colonial rule] was the blatantly pro-business bias in the government's decision-making.""* There has been *""collusion between the colonial officialdom and the British economic elites.""* Indeed, *""the colonial regime has been at fault for its subservience to business interests as manifested in its unwillingness until very recently, not because of laissez-faire but from its pro-business bias, to legislate against cartels and monopolies and to regulate economic activities in the interests of labor, consumers and the environment . . . In other words, free trade and free enterprise with an open market . . . did not always mean fair trade and equal opportunity: the regime intervened to favor British and big business interests at the expense of both fair play and of a level playing field for all economic players regardless of class or race.""* [Ming K Chan, *""The Legacy of the British Administration of Hong Kong: A View from Hong Kong,""* pp. 567-582, The China Quarterly, no. 151, p. 577, p. 576, p. 575 and pp. 575-6] Bell notes that a British corporation *""held the local telephone monopoly until 1995""* while another *""holds all the landing rights at Hong Kong airport.""* [Op. Cit., p. 21] 

Unsurprisingly, as it owns all the land, the government has *""a strong position in commanding resources to direct spatial development in the territory.""* There is a *""three-tiered system of land-use plans.""* The top-level, for example, *""maps out the overall land development strategy to meet the long-term socio-economic needs of Hong Kong""* and it is *""prepared and reviewed by the administration and there is no public input to it.""* This planning system is, as noted, heavily influenced by the business sector and its *""committees operate largely behind closed doors and policy formulation could be likened to a black-box operation.""* *""Traditionally,""* Ng notes, *""the closed door and Hong Kong centered urban planning system had served to maintain economic dynamism in the colony. With democratization introduced in the 1980s, the planning system is forced to be more open and to serve not just economic interests.""* [Mae Kam Ng, Op. Cit., p. 11, p. 39, p. 37 and p. 13] As Chan stresses, *""the colonial government has continuously played a direct and crucial role as a very significant economic participant. Besides its control of valuable resources, the regime's command of the relevant legal, political and social institutions and processes also indirectly shapes economic behavior and societal development.""* [Op. Cit., p. 574] 

Overall, as Bell notes, *""one cannot help but notice the large gap between this reality and the myth of an open and competitive market where only talent and luck determine the economic winners.""* [Op. Cit., p. 16] As an expert in the Asian Tiger economies summarizes:

&gt;*""to conclude . . . that Hong Kong is close to a free market economy is misleading . . . Not only is the economy managed from outside the formal institutions of government by the informal coalition of peak private economic organizations, but government itself also has available some unusual instruments for influencing industrial activity. It owns all the land. . . It controls rents in part of the public housing market and supplies subsidized public housing to roughly half the population, thereby helping to keep down the cost of labor And its ability to increase or decrease the flow of immigrants from China also gives it a way of affecting labor costs.""* [Robert Wade, Governing the Market, p. 332] 

This means that the Hong Kong system of ""laissez-faire"" is marked by the state having close ties with the major banks and trading companies, which, in turn, are closely linked to the life-time expatriates who largely run the government. This provides a *""point of concentration""* to conduct negotiations in line with an implicit development strategy. Therefore it is pretty clear that Hong Kong does not really show the benefits of ""free market"" capitalism. Wade indicates that we can consider Hong Kong as a *""special case or as a less successful variant of the authoritarian-capitalist state.""* [Op. Cit., p. 333] 
There are other explanations for Hong Kong's high growth rates than simply ""capitalism."" Firstly, Hong Kong is a city state and cities have a higher economic growth rate than regions (which are held back by large rural areas). This is because the agricultural sector rarely achieves high economic growth rates and so in its absence a high growth rate is easier to achieve. Secondly, there is Hong Kong's location and its corresponding role as an entrep√¥t economy. Wade notes that *""its economic growth is a function of its service role in a wider regional economy, as entrep√¥t trader, regional headquarters for multinational companies, and refuge for nervous money.""* [Op. Cit., p. 331] Being between China and the rest of the world means its traders could act as a middleman, earning income from the mark-up they could impose on good going through the territory. This is why Hong Kong is often referred to as an entrep√¥t economy, a place that imports, stores, and re-exports goods. In other words, Hong Kong made a lot of its money because many Chinese exports and imports went through it and its traders marked-up the prices. It should be obvious if most of Western Europe's goods went through, say, Liverpool, that city would have a very good economic performance regardless of other factors. This option is hardly available to most cities, never mind countries. 

Then there is the issue of state ownership of land. As Mae Kam Ng reports, monopoly ownership of all land by the state sets the context for super-profits by government and finance capital generally. [Op. Cit., p. 13] Unsurprisingly, most government land *""is sold to just three real-estate developers""* who *""sit on huge tracts of land, drop-feeding apartments onto the market so as to maintain high property prices.""* Between 1992 and 1996, for example, prices increased fourfold and profits doubled. The heads of two of the property firms were on the list of the world's ten richest men in 1998. *""Meanwhile, potential new entrants to the market are restricted by the huge cost of paying land-conversion premiums that are the bedrock of government revenues.""* This is a *""cozy arrangement between the government and major developers.""* [Daniel A. Bell, Op. Cit., p. 16]

t3_bm27h,AskReddit,37,0, transportation ,"Trained MSF instructor, adrenaline junkie, and long-time rider here.  I'll address each of your questions in order.

1. A motorcycle is a viable year-round mode of transportation wherever you don't get nasty rain/snow for a large part of the year.  Otherwise, reconsider.  5-10/year of dangerous icy/snowy roads for *cars* means at least a month of motorcycle danger.  You will need a rain suit, maybe a seat and handlebar warmers, and warm clothes.

2. There is the Hurt Report, and the MSF and states have stats of accidents.  Non-trained riders are 4 times more likely to have a fatal motorcycle crash.  The biggest culprit for untrained rider accidents is not knowing about counter steering and about friction zones on those tyres.

2.1 Whenever you ride, wear a full face helmet.  Your likelihood to survive triples vs. no helmet, and doubles vs. idiotic head buckets, open face helmets, etc.  Even if you are on a scooter.

2.1.1 [This is not a full face helmet](http://www.benhopson.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/flip-face-helmet-ii.gif) - it's a flip face and the face will flip if you hit it hard enough.  Full face is one piece.

2.2 Appropriate gear that you MUST wear at all times if you're a commuter:  helmet, **leather** jacket, **leather** gloves, ankle-high boots.  Kudos if you wear some form of leg protection.  If you have a rain suit, wear it ON TOP of the leather kit or get one made of abrasion resistant material.  Leather works best, though.  Get a **leather** jacket with vents for summer, but always you and your passenger must wear leather.  No other material has its resistance to abrasion and I rather mess up the cow's skin than my skin with road rash.

3. BMW motorcycles come with ABS - I'm a BMW rider and can attest that ABS saved my life at least once on bad road conditions (wet, gravel).  Harleys are fine if you're into that sort of thing, I guess... but I don't know if they are as well-engineered as a BMW.  The company priorities are different.  BMW bikes are designed to be ridden year-around in Europe, if that's any guide for you.

4. Insurance cost:  expect to pay a LOT right off the bat; divide it by half when you get an MSF course under your belt, then knock another 30% off if you take the advanced rider MSF course (you need to have ridden for 3 years or have 3,000 miles at least under your belt).  The insurance rates also vary by state.

4.1 Some states will automatically give you a motorcycle license upon successful completion of the MSF intro course.  Check MD's laws and go to the MSF site for infos.  Their web site is out of date for some reason so you may want to check with the DMV.  Unlike car driving tests, the motorcycle riding test is very, very, very hard and easy to flunk.  Kill two stones with one bird ( ;) ) and do the course + license if you can.

(On the other hand, do the course then the license test and you're almost guaranteed to pass - extra kudos if you do!)

Good luck, have fun, and keep the rubber side down!

Until then, the statements and observations in this movie seem spot on and in direct accordance with the literature I have read and other documentaries I have seen on the topic.

You did not put out a photgraph of Monsanto. Where is that photo? How does this photo demonstrate Monsanto polluting the environment.

Let's also talk about pollution and cancer. Please show the link of the pollution being created by Monsanto. Please show that urban pollution is primarily caused by Monsanto rather than automobile traffic. The incidence of lung cancers in urban settings, as far as I know is primarily linked with particualtes, which is primarily from auto emissions.

So which is this a picture of a refinery? or something else? Based on the stacks, it is either a refinery or plastics production process. The steam you see rising is likely from a cooling process and not polluting at all.

The links you provided on Occidental are from Peru, and Columbia, not Niagra Falls.

You also seem to be confusing SO2 from Coal power plants with refineries. SO2 is dipersed temporaly and spatial by the use of tall stacks.

Steam is not a polluting source. Steam is not used to disperse SO2. 

CO2 is simply carbon dioxide. You breathe that out.

Dioxins:

The chemical industry is not an important source of PCDDs/PCDFs according to national emission inventories in European countries such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden. Combustion processes are considered to be an important primary source of PCDDs/PCDFs (ref. Wormgoor, Bj√∂rndal). Most thermal processes which involve burning organic and inorganic compounds containing chlorine atoms e.g. sodium chloride, result in the formation of PCDDs/PCDFs. Of special importance is the incineration of various types of municipal, hospital and hazardous wastes. Production of steel and non-ferrous metals (copper, magnesium, nickel‚Ä¶) are other notable sources.

It is commonly accepted today that formation of dioxin-like compounds in flue gases happens in a temperature range of 200 to 400¬∞C, especially in poor combustion conditions leading to incomplete conversion and the formation of carbon in the fly ashes. Levels of dioxins in flue gases of incinerators depends on the well known 3 T rule:

    * Temperature above 850¬∞C
    * Time (residence) typically 2 seconds
    * Turbulence optimised by furnace geometry and secondary air.

As PCDDs/PCDFs are mainly fixed onto fly ashes, the effectiveness of the dust separation is of paramount importance.

Recently the UK Authorities published a review of dioxin emissions into air (1995). The dominant source was the incineration of municipal solid waste representing 70% of the total industrial sources. Other major emissions, representing 23% of the total industrial emissions were:

. steel mills

. combustion of coal (energy, fuel)

. iron and steel plants

t3_blq9w,bicycling,1,0, transportation ,"I'm not sure how to respond to this. ""Slow down when approaching an intersection"" isn't exactly oppressive or unfair, is it? Cars are advised to do so. Cruising through an intersection at speeds (even ""normal"" speeds such as 40mph) that leave you no recourse for avoiding obstacles or pedestrians is quite unsafe. I fail to see how telling cyclists and motorists to slow down makes cycling MORE dangerous. 

The real truth here largely lies in attitudes. As you've displayed, there is some sort of strange (and largely American) sense of entitlement going on here. These roads were not designed for bicycles. They were designed for cars and trucks, vans, freighters etc. We are on bicycles. It's always seemed rather silly to me to hear people try and treat these two modes of transportation the same. As long as cars are on the same roads as bikes, it will be their responsibility to be cautious and alert. As long as you are on the same roads as cars, it will be your responsibility to protect your own life by being cautious and remembering that when you are dead or a quadriplegic, it doesn't really matter who's fault it was. 

What makes biking unattractive to people that biking is unattractive to is largely laziness and absurd city planning with regard to distances. For instance, I live in Austin. It is the only city in Texas that I've ever been to that I would even begin to consider riding a bike. It just doesn't make any sense anywhere else. Try commuting in Houston sometime. Or Dallas. Or Lubbock. 

We have to be realistic about these issues; and it is going to take compromise. We won't all be able to go bombing around town, cars and bikes alike, listening to headphones and talking on cellphones and eating watermelons, with no regard for anything other than how fast we can get somewhere.

t3_bm2lx,Economics,3,0, metro ,"I think a 'USAA Member' is a different distinction from an account holder at USAA, I'm not certain as things are much different from when I joined over 10 years ago.

The ability to get insurence is one of those products that has limited availability.  Last week USAA sent out some adverts that they had opened membership to anyone who had served honourably in the US military any time in history.  Prior to this you had to have joined while under an active enlistment/commission, or have been retired military.

My understanding is that with the DoD mandating direct deposit back in the late 90's the surge of capital allowed the USAA FSB arm of the business to build a ton more recurring capital deposits, and that has allowed them to broaden their customer base without any large overhead increases (no local branches anywhere until recently... I think there are 3 at most, and the 'USAA compound' is in San Antonio TX, a cheaper place to operate from than other metro areas).

In any case they are a 'member owned' institution (we members get a cut of the dividends which equates to a feee month of insurance for the plebeians like myself).  That's my favourite part about banking with them, no stock holders to appease, just the people whose money they have."

t3_bm27h,AskReddit,6,0, transportation ,"During the dot-com bust I ended up in bad financial shape so my motorcycle became my primary means of transportation for about 18 months.  I had the all weather gear already, so it was an easy decision.  Here is what I found out:

1. You can ride year-round throughout most of California, if you don't mind the cold.

2. If possible/affordable, get heated grips, or get nice thick warm gloves.

3. The rain is a pain, even with a high-quality rain suit.  It just makes riding more dangerous.  If you're caught in anything strong you're safer pulling over and waiting for the rain to pass.  Get some coffee.

4. Your girlfriend/boyfriend/significant other will get tired of riding bitch, so plan on renting a car once in a while.

5. My motorcycle has saddle bags, so I became an ace at packing things, from groceries to clothes for trips.  If you plan to ride for commuting, get roomy saddle bags.  Their downside?  Harder to cut through traffic.  BMW saddle bags are particularly large but they're designed for stowing your helmets and still have extra room.  That's enough for 3 bags of groceries without crushing the eggs or bruising the tomatoes.

6. You **must** pay extra attention to your tyres.  Get all weather Dunlop, Battle Axe, etc. pretty much anything of good quality but ensure that you get commuter/all weather tyres.  Check the pressure at least once a week, even if you ride daily.

Peace is easy, the question is what conditions do you place for peace. Is it, as Hamas asserts, war until all of Israel is returned to Islamic control? Or peace with two countries side by side?

&gt;Their rockets have killed and injured very few Israelis, compared to the many thousands of people which Israel have killed, a huge percentage of them children.

Huge %? And how much of that is because of the kind of war that Hamas fights? How much is because after Oslo Arafat sent the Palestinian children out to fight a war? And I think you grossly underestimate the effectiveness of the Palestinian terror campaign. Setting off bombs in markets and restaurants and nightclubs affects everyone in the country. Imagine a 9/11 a year for years.

&gt;But Britain never ever used this as an excuse to murder Irish/Catholic civilians in Northern Ireland, unlike Israel.

Actually they did. And the IRA did far less damage to Britain than Fatah/Hamas do towards Israel. If you want to see unleashed, look at [Grozny]http://www.time.com/time/daily/special/photo/grozny/index.html) in the [Second Chechen War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War). Urban guerrilla wars lead to lots of civilian dead.

Have you ever heard of NATO?  Who the hell do you think is the major financier of that?  We are, we make up half of the budget for NATO, which includes 27 other countries including your utopian societies like Norway, France, and Belgium.  They don't have to pay anywhere near what they would have to if they supplied their own military outright. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO

Even France the on again off again member, know that if they were attacked ever we would be the ones to save them.  Who do you think is Japan's military? We are.  They are not allowed to have an offensive military (article 9) of their constitution, we signed a security treaty with them that states that we would come to their rescue if attacked. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Mutual_Cooperation_and_Security_between_the_United_States_and_Japan

Or even as far back as SEATO for the southeast, including Australia.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia_Collective_Defense_Treaty

Who pays for most of the development of this weapons they use?  We do. Who pays to train most of them? We do.  Who leads the way when there is a problem? We do.

So, no I don't assume anything. 

I think your logic is messed up, we had social programs because we could afford them, not that they allowed us to afford them.  It's funny you argue that we were prospering the most in our history at this point and so we have social programs.  How does that work?  The people made so much money they needed help paying for things?  If we were that prosperous at that point we wouldn't need the social programs.  Use your own logic, social programs have been growing since the 1950's and we have been going down hill. 

Also, another funny fact, everyone keeps yelling we spend too much on military! In 1955 70% of national budget was on military, by the 80's it was 25-30%, now it's down to 20% not including Iraq war, which isn't going to last forever. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/27/U.S._Defense_Spending_-_%25_to_Outlays.png

If you look up the budget for U.S. (2005 last complete graph I found on WIKI) says we spent 18% on military, but 22% on social security alone. If you add up S.S., medicare, education, health plans, and income securities, it comes out to 63% of national spending.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_budget_process#Direct_Spending

So since the fifties we have inverted our paying out from military to social programs and you are pissed because why? Oh, and the countries gone to hell."
t3_bkkmo,politics,1,0, urban ,"&gt;Anyone who studies Jewish History.

Anyone who studies jewish history is an authority on jewish history, and that's all.  Not on what's right or wrong, or even what's best or not, and certainly not on who is a 'true christian' and who isn't.   Claiming otherwise, directly or indirectly just makes no sense.  And no, there is no clear criteria proving that christ was referring to the ten commandments and not all of the collection of jewish law.

&gt;&gt;including the slaying of those of other faiths, slaying women not virgins on their wedding night, etc, etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;There were no rules laid out that all people of other faiths should be slain.

2 Chronicles 15:13, Deuteronomy 13:13-19, Deuteronomy 13:7-12, Deuteronomy 17:2-5

&gt;That example is one of the easier to understand, but it is the same basic principal that is applied to others, like the death penalty for what we would now see as minor crimes. At that point in history, they needed that severe of a consequence to be deterred.

What you're getting at makes sense in the context of an ancient society that, probably like many others, had experiences with what happened as a result of crowded and unsanitary urban conditions, with no germ theory to explain why the presence of a few sick people caused many to fall ill.  Sure they passed rules to forbid the presence of the sick in, for example, places of worship.  Along with many other rules of that kind.

And, of course, there were city-states that had to be aware of infiltrators from other city-states and other political/religious conflicts, and needed rules to deal with those situations.  The list of such conditions most likely goes on and on, for which rules and punishments were needed.  

And, of course, the mental habit of eliminating the different, like most mental habits, was extrapolated into places where it made little sense.   Codified into random collections of ancient texts over time, you end up with a compendium of what appears to be laws. possible even morality, the embellishments of ancient authors taken into account.  Does that make it a unified book of law and morality to be referenced as if written by one author or even one body?  Hardly - it makes it a view into ancient societies and how they coped with the challenges of urban life - nothing more.

Not to mention that the  earlier point of logical fallacy is entirely applicable.  It is a 'no true Scotsman' fallacy to assert that 'no true christian would...'  Any criteria for what qualifies as a 'true christian' is purely subjective interpretation.  

That's exactly why there are so many christian sects instead of one.   The abounding lack of clear criteria, as a result of the bible being nothing more that a varied collection of disjoint books, all written by different authors, only edited in a vain attempt to make it look like a book of consistent authorship.  It factually isn't.

So you will in fact, and in reality do, have one group claiming a christian is one thing, and another group claiming a christian is something else, both with equal weights of bible text to back up their claims."

Local buses are cheap they cost 280kr per ride and you can get a change ticket that lasts about an hour and you can take as many buses as you please. You can even lower the price by buying either 2 week card (called the yellow card) but it only pays off if you travel on the buses atlest every day. So my advice is to buy bus tickets - you get 12 for 2500kr. One thing you have to look out for when taking the buses is they stop running at 24:00 and on weekends they dont run as often, same goes after 17:00 every day, only  2 trips an hour. Normally it's every 15 min during day time. Taxis are rather expensive but you might need them during weekend while partying. You can call 003545885522 for a taxi but after 03:00 o'clock during weekends if you are down town and need to catch a taxi then they are lined up in Laekjagata just across the Pond (tjornin), you will know these two names pretty fast when you get there. 

3) Golden circle, Blue Lagoon and Horseback riding are the top 3 things to do normally. But we have a volcano eruption atm in Myrdalsjokull so you might want to see that as well. There are many trips and companies going to these things. Netbus offers the cheapest trips to the Blue lagoon (5500kr with a pickup from your hotel) and the golden circle (7600kr with a pickup). Iceland Excursion and Reykjavik Excursion are the two biggest traveling companies in Iceland they will offer almost every trip you want. Iceland Excursion has the cheapest volcano trip but its with a bus (7600kr with a pickup). There are at least 3 different horseback riding companies close to Reykjavik all with different trips and landscape so just look at what each has to offer. Whale watching is also very populair they just started going every day again at 13:00. Another trip you might want to take is the South Shore. For all events coming up you might want to grab a paper called Grapevine - it has every single event going in the big Reykjavik area even the rly small ones like live music with unknown bands. Never go down town before 01:00 during weekends no one is there until then. 

For the nomnom things first priority is the Baejarins bestu which is a hotdog stand its cheap but so very good. American style is cheap and has the best burgers by far. Ruby Thuesday and Fridays are rather cheap but american food is served there. If you want Italian food Italia is the place its not expensive and rly good. The best Indian place is Austur India Felagid (the eastern indian company) they are the best restaurant in Iceland in my opinion. If you want steaks Argentina Steakhouse or Hereford Steakhouse are on the top. The Sushi place in Ida is rly cheap and good. If you want fish then Saegreifinn (the sea baron) is rly fun and cheap good food as well, or Sjavarkjallarinn (the sea cellar) a bit more expensive but rly good food. If you want to try a bit of Icelandic food then I suggest either Fjorukrainn (its in another town so 20 min bus fare from Reykjavik but you get a viking show and real old Icelandic cusin), or islenski barinn its down town and you can get nice lunch offers there.

4) I do recommend that you go to tourist information stations. Here is a homepage for one of them they have two infomarion stations down town, three at hotels. www.ita.is you can contact them with any questions before your trip. Hope you enjoy your trip to Iceland :)"

And here in BC, we had BC rail run as a government railway at a loss for a number of years.  We did so because we had rural resources that needed to be mined, and no way to get them to ship out.

&gt;You really make the case that plant biology, being especially hard to work with, would benefit from more open information sharing so the wheel is not re-invented repeatedly. 

The wheel isn't reinvented every time. The whole point of the patent system is that it incentivizes companies to share their discoveries rather than keep them secret by providing protections to whoever discloses their data first.

Open source would be nice, but open source relies on volunteer work from passionate geniuses with spare time. The nature of biology means that this isn't very practical (see above). University research has proven ineffective at mass-producing useful seed for farmers.

&gt;If labs of geneticists are doing hard work and not getting paid, of course some business controls are needed to protect them.

Agribusiness is plently profitable by itself. I agree that corn subsidies are stupid, but that has very little to do with genetic engineering. I should also add that farmers buy genetically engineered crops from Monsanto and several other companies not because they're forced to, but because it's more profitable.

--Shopkeepers often 'forget' to give a fiver back when an American makes a purchase.
  Yes, it is cruel, but Americans rather ask for it by being incapable of thinking in anything other than dollars. 

--I'm stupid because I don't understand references to shows on the telly such as Don't Forget Your Toothbrush and The Magic Roundabout.
  Oh come on, everyone has their own culture.  Oops, my mistake, you are American.

--6 hours of sheep dog trials from New Zealand is not entertaining television.
  Ok, so you picked a bad night.  But think about it for a moment.  6hrs of actual program content is far more than you get on most US TV in a week's worth of viewing time.

--England did not win WWII with 'a bit' of American help.
  Oh dear, an American favourite.  The war in Europe was won before the US even arrived.
  How so ?  Stalingrad.  The Nazis never lost a battle before Stalingrad and never won one after.  The battle of Stalingrad destroyed the German army. They never could recover.
  Of course, the US did supply a lot of armaments, for which you extracted your pound of flesh.

--A tiny amount of 190 degree water is not a substitute for a large amount of 140 degree water. (Fahrenheit)
  Eh ?  Do try to catch up with the rest of the world.

--The motorcar has been around 100 years, do consider designing roads taking this fact into consideration.
  We do, our modern roads are much faster than your freeways, problem is the rest of it was planned, and I use the term loosely, well before 100 years ago.

--Schoolboy buggery isn't fun for 50% of the participants.
  Difficult for me to comment on because I never went to public school (what to you is private school).
  Look, to keep it short, the aristocracy are not like the rest of us, believe me, they are just different.

--Two adults of normal weight shouldn't have to slide sideways to pass when meeting on a stairwell.
  You are not supposed to pass on stairwells, it is bad luck !

--India isn't grateful for your 'help'.
  Oh dear, another American favourite. Some bits were very grateful and others were not.  How do you think a small country controls a large one ?
  Well you could use shock and awe, as the US does, but it has never been tried against a bigger country has it ?
  The Empire used divide and conquer, it got results without wholesale slaughter.  If the Empire killed in India at the rate US killed in Iraq there would not have many left to  celebrate independence.  

--While you think you are all 'British', the Scots, Welsh and others are fully aware there are the 'English' and 'others'.
  You really should not listen to Gordon Brown.  There are the English, the Scots, the Welsh, the Irish and the Cornish. The rest call themselves British and Gordon Brown calls all
  of us British, apart from the Scots, who retain their distinctive name, unless they are politicians in London, in which case they are at all times British. Got it? 

--After 18 months I could not understand the actual dialect of your country, 'yob'.
  There is no dialect, there are many.  No wonder you were confused.

--You treated Di like shit until she was dead, then had a nationwide attack of amnesia.
  Aristocracy again.  Di was an aristocrat, arguably better bred than Her Majesty herself.  Every now and again the people become infatuated by some aristocrat,
  Di was such an example.  The people didn't treat her like shit, it was other aristo's.

--For a people so concerned with 'good breeding', you pointedly ignore the several hundred years you've been exporting your best DNA.
  You really don't get aristocracy do you ?  It has nothing to do with ""quality"" of DNA or quality of anything else for that matter. 
  It has everything to do with how long your family have owned their stately pile and how long they have been at court, in this case the royal court.
  But you are quite correct about exporting the best DNA, much of it has gone to your own country.  Even so, even the best DNA can't perform miracles against the rise of
  Chinese DNA.  The US is fucked, just like the rest of the west.

--1066 was actually a defeat.
  Jesus Christ ! Aristocracy again, FFS stop passing comments on something you clearly have not got a clue about.
  1066 was regime change.  The Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was replaced by the Norman aristocracy.  Again, to keep it brief, William, Duke of Normandy got a lucky win
  against the Anglo-Saxon king Harold, who had just seen off the Norwegian King Harald, so was feeling a little tired and not at his best.
   
  William declared himself king and owner of everything by right on conquest. Now, to be fair to William, he didn't just think one day that ""me and my posse"" are going to have
  a piece of England, he thought he had a valid claim to the English throne, but he was not the only one, Harald of Norway thought the same.
  This came about because of the way these people were all interrelated through marriages.
  Once again, keeping if brief, if king A wanted to conclude a treaty with king B he would send a daughter to be married to one of king B's sons.
  So if a king died without any obvious heir (ie a son or brother) then the throne could be legitably be taken by anyone with a valid claim.
  Now the previous Anglo-Saxon king, Edward the confessor, had indeed died without an heir, leaving the throne available to anyone who could show they were related.

  That is why the aristocrats have such a thing about producing an heir, and incidentally what Di was all about.  


--The Romans left due to problems elsewhere, not due to one posed by the locals.
  Quite so, except for the Scots.  Any Scot will tell you the Romans never conquered Scotland (even if it was inhabited by Picts rather than Scots at the time).

--Top Gear misleadingly edited the Tesla episode.
  Bugger !

--The English drink a lot of Budweiser.
  Yes, but isn't that the real one rather than the pale US imitation ?

--BSE was your own fault (Cattle should not be forced to be cannibals)

The atmosphere where I train is kind of a mix of competitive and collaborative, so that really helps keep it relaxed.

t3_bluzb,politics,2,0, train ,"I have worked in rock quarry and small building demolition for 8 years. Unlike people like yourself, I know what I'm talking about when it comes to explosives and demolition.

I seriously need to save what I'm going to say below because I've had to have typed this out a dozen times in response to clueless Truthers. 

PLANTED EXPLOSIVES

Common high explosives used in building demolition include dynamite and RDX (detchord) along with shaped charged moldings. Those are the primary explosives that must be detonated by means of blasting cap which are usually comprised of acetone peroxide, mercury fulminate, etc. Primary explosives are usually stable and not susceptible detonation by heat, while boosters (blasting caps) are. 

In the event of a planned explosion, the building is stripped, gutted, and have many support structures weakened to where the rest of the structure is taken down by shaped charges in sequence. The tallest building that had been imploded was around 40 levels. The time taken to prep a large building is week to months in some cases. The actual amount of explosives used within a demolition project of that magnitude would be in the tons. That is thousands of pounds of high explosive needed to demolish a single building. 

To create a sequence of demolition, you would have miles of wire and detchord going through an entire building that is checked and rechecked. By no means can this be just 'hidden' in a building where people work everyday. You would not be able to smuggle in ten tons of high explosive, carefully place it, and run the wiring for each individual blasting cap without being noticed.

PREMATURE DEFLAGRATION

One reason why planted explosives within the towers and definitely the collapse of building 7 are completely impossible is that the primary explosives would have prematurely deflagrated that is if the boosters would have not detonated. This means they would BURN and NOT EXPLODE. No burning building has ever been demolished by explosives because it is damn near impossible. You would have to shield the primary from heat, definitely shield the boosters from ANY heat, and all of the wiring as well. Before someone says ""wireless"", that would have tripled the complexity of the demo job, while making the degree of failure much higher.

People who think WTC 7 which suffered heavy fire damage for 8 hours before collapsing could have been rigged with explosives also must be the same dumbass who thinks fireworks in a cardboard box in a bonfire won't go off suddenly. 

THERMITE and NANO-THERMITE

Thermite is not used in building demolition because it is not only very sloppy of a burn, but burns in the direction of gravity. What thermite is used for is heavy metal welding. One example would be the fusion of train track rails. 

Thermite could never have been used in any part of the demolition on 9/11 because it would have failed by being ignited shortly after the planes hit the buildings. The amount of thermite that would have to be used would be in the tons. It is a powder that would have to be contained in a fashion that uniformly surrounded a beam, while also having some kind of blocker that keeps it from just vertically dripping down.

Nano-thermite was the next thing these stupid Truthers tried telling the world about. This one was funny. When regular thermite was shot down just like I have said above, Truthers devised this hilarious idea of some secret thing called nano-thermite, which 'could be painted on that would have the intensity of regular thermite'. That was actually what some Truther told me, while I laughed. 

Nano-thermite does exist, but not in the super secret fashion they made it out to be. Nano-thermite is nothing more than regular thermite mixed into a finer mesh thus making it burn easier and quicker (not necessarily meaning it could burn through metal faster). It is currently used in commercial electric matches. In short, the idea of using thermite of any mixture as a talking point regarding 9/11 just shows the level of intelligence a person has on the issue.

So there you go, Johnny Cash. I dumbed it down for you a little. I know quite a bit more about demolition and explosives than you probably do. Unless you plan on adding anything to the debate, shut the fuck up and go back into your mother's basement."

Add to that minimum wage laws and labor laws and you really have to crazy to set your company up for a legal fall/fail with this.  But I'm no longer surprised by the pervasiveness of corporate stupidity.  Hope they fry!

The labor laws are pretty clear and yet frankly it would be hard to imagine most companies actually qualifying for the ""unpaid exception"".  These are the 6 conditions that must be all met:

1.	The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to what would be given in a vocational school or academic educational instruction; *(in corporate America - laughable outside the Fortune 20)*

2.	The training is for the benefit of the trainees; *(well hopefully but not sure that companies would take the effort nor know how to assure this legally)*

3.	The trainees do not displace regular employees, but work under their close observation; *(often doable though it could be dicey - H-visa sensitivities abounding already and all)*

4.	The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees, and on occasion the employer‚Äôs operations may actually be impeded;  *(This is the hot potato that should have said ""avoid unpaid internships""!!  It's laughable any intern would be taken on in most of corporate America under such conditions! It simply would never have been the point of taking an intern.)*

5.	The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the training period; *(mostly can be a contractual sign-off)* and

6.	The employer and the trainees understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training.  *(again, contractual boilerplate)*

It's not that hard to simply pay interns.  Really.  I had internships throughout college and all were paid and essentially ""real work"" in my profession.  Don't have to worry about the above.

Basically unpaid internships are just an obvious scam to get free labor rather than train the next generation and locate talent (which is what it really always should be from a company's perspective).

t3_bm67j,Seattle,4,0, urban ,"I'm a huge fan of Capitol Hill, but of course it all depends on what you're looking for.

What attracts me to Capitol Hill rather than a place like Ravenna is the density: Here I can walk to most places I'd want to go, and I'm always discovering new events and stores and restaurants right under my nose. If closely located awesomeness is important to you, then definitely move here. Woostastik has the other side right, although ambulances and street rats depends entirely on your location. There are definitely some more quiet residential areas here, but they'll always be a little more expensive than Ravenna, and yard-less.

I live near the Olive/Denny intersection, and pay $1000 for a decently large two bedroom with my girlfriend and another roommate. I've just started looking for a new cheaper place here, and it looks like it'll be pretty easy, especially if I **walk down the street and phone places rather than just read craigslist**. If you really want a yard, while still being reasonably close to Capitol Hill, try the CD/Cap Hill divide: Olive and 22nd, Pike and 25th, the back side of Cherry Hill, etc. If you're just into it for the gardening/food, you may be able to sign up for an urban garden.

t3_bm2st,badcompany2,3,0, urban ,"Here are some tips for playing as recon. 

1)  Use the mortor strike as often as you can.  One example being - if you see your teammates about to arm an MCOM. then call in a mortar strike on that area. (Only if FF is off).  This prevents the opposition from coming in to disable the MCOM and it will buy your teammates some time.  

2)   When playing as attacker - If the MCOM is underneath a shed, take out the roof and surrounding walls. This makes it easier to spot enemy troops hiding around that area and makes it easier to spot your own guys. (i.e the right most MCOM on the isle innocentes Island) See point #1

3)  As another poster said - do not shoot at the first guy you see. Concealment and cover are the most important things for surviving.  Pick your targets wisely. Instead of killing someone that could potentially sneak up on your six after he respawns, just put the orange triangle on him. Let someone else deal with him. 

4)  Back to points #1 and #2. Wait for several enemy troops to bunch up in one area - then call in a mortar strike.  More effective and more bang for the buck.

5) Learn to compensate for bullet drop. I think there is a link floating around on reddit that describes that in graphical detail. 

6) When sniping from within the enemy's base or urban area, learn to use the motion sensor. Just deploy one at a time. 

7) Never shoot with the skyline behind you. You're just painting a big bullseye on yourself.   Learn to use large plants and brush to conceal your position. Shoot and then go back behind a bush. If sniping from a hill,  move back and lower your profile after a successful shot. This will also confuse the victim if he's trying to figure out your position via the Kill Cam. 

8) Also, if one of your squadmate is standing beside you shooting with an LMG. Move away from him. He is just drawing unnecessary attention towards your position.  Those LMGs have tracer rounds. So its easier for the enemy to zero-in on the general location. 

9) Carry a decent sidearm with you. Like the 1911. It will come in handy when someone comes up to you. Trying to win a close-quarter gunfight with a sniper rifle isn't very practical or fun. Play a few rounds with only using the 1911 pistol. Learn to empty a clip in the head instead of shooting at center-mass.    Unless you have unlocked the VSS and have steady hands. 

10) Probably not important - but something to consider. That is to conserve your ammo. Plenty of times, I have been part of a squad full of snipers. Ran out of ammo and had to go down to the action to get some. Sometimes its easier just to commit suicide and respawn with full ammo. But that will cost your team a ticket.(if it is the attacking side)

11) If you find a good spot to snipe from - it is important that you limit your cone of fire by being next to a large blocking object such as a wall or side of a hill or boulder. This might run counter to most people's tactic. The reason being - its less area you have to scan and worry about someone coming from your flank.  It also limits the number of the orange triangles you have to keep track of.  For me that tactic has worked well. I usually eye ball only one MCOM and the surrounding area.  That will also help your team in securing that area quicker.  Might not work for everyone. 

12)  Always spot!!!!. I cannot stress this enough. You will be doing your team a big favor and also will earn some points in return!

13) Finally, the most important point - Always keep moving. Kill couple of guys and go find another spot immediately. SCOOT AND SHOOT!!.  If you shoot another sniper and you didn't kill him. Then move to a new location far off from the original shot. Chances are , that sniper can zero-in on your position and he might not miss your head. Also, if you get hit and don't die. Move immediately!!!. Because the next shot will definitely kill you. Back off momentarily behind some cover and try to figure out where the shot came from.

t3_blzfm,WeAreTheMusicMakers,2,0, bus ,"I'm still a learner(of a few years now) when it comes to mix and master, but here are some starters:

* ""Mixing"" and ""Mastering"" are terms which have blurred. A mix is a summation of tracks - so mixing could refer to a simple ""downmix"" (e.g. stereo to mono) or to a more elaborate process of processing, cuts, and splices (""radio mix"" ""club mix"" etc.). Mastering used to refer to the process needed to make a mix play on the final format(vinyl, cassette tape, etc.) which involved some control of levels and frequencies to insure that the device's machinery wouldn't break. In the digital era the meaning of mastering has gravitated to ""black magic and fairy dust"" applied on a final mix - generally speaking, anything you slap on top of the entire mix counts as a mastering process.

* Set goals for the mix: some examples are emphasis on a certain part, maximization of frequency coverage, or maybe bringing out a ""live feel"" to the song.

* Depending on the goals you set and the source material, you may have to do very little to each part for a good mix. A common commercial mixing strategy is to make each part completely command a certain spectrum of frequency by EQ'ing out anything outside its chosen territory. This can be unintuitive at times. (kick drum and bass often conflict, for example) Afterwards, the resulting parts can each be heavily compressed for loudness. This is _not_ a natural sound and you can make a great mix with much less processing by making sure the basic arrangement and recording doesn't suck.

* On the point of compression - learn what it does. It lets you transform the character of sounds via the dynamics - a compressor with a short attack, a very high dB threshold(ex. -5dB) and a high ratio will squash a part so that(after post-gain) it sounds REALLY BIG - which makes it easy to start putting on everything unnecessarily. For a different example, compression can tame piercing, obnoxious instruments: Use a lower threshold, a longer attack, and more moderate amounts of compression. Light bus compression helps to smooth over mixes with too many dynamics(a great situation to be in) - overdoing it will make the mix pump, which is only good if you're a dance producer.

* Start listening to songs for their production. Compare mixes from the 60s and 70s, which usually have very little processing, to modern hyper-compressed ones. Compare different genres - hiphop, country, and house all use broadly different mix strategies.

* Mix at a very low conversation-level volume and try to stay on the side of lowering volumes, not raising them. Higher volumes make things sound better temporarily(this is essentially why we have loudness wars) but do not fix actual problems with the mix. You will wake up after hours of mixing late into the night only to discover that it sucks.

* When you can do things in a simple and safe way, use the simple and safe way. Sometimes all you have to do is ""ride the faders"", using some volume automation and panning to keep parts in balance."

There are tens of thousands of bikes located at over a thousand spots around the city. You can take a bike from any spot and drop it off at any other. The only restriction is that you can only use a single bike for 30 minutes at a time or else you have to pay a late fee.

t3_bm27h,AskReddit,2,0, transportation ,"I used a motorcycle as my only source of transportation for 5 or so years.  Here are some bullet points:

+ My bike was hell fast, and I was addicted to speed.  The reason I bought it was that a $14,000 bike was what I could just barely afford at the time, and it could perform better than a $100,000 car. 

+ Girls liked it.  I had several very nice hook-ups thanks to the bike.  Twice I had (extremely hot) girls chase or flag me down for a ride without even knowing anything about me.  For all they knew I was a total turd under that helmet.

+ Total cost of ownership is way less than a car, though factor in that you really should spend the money to keep it in top shape.  Motorcycles are less forgiving of mechanical failures than cars.

+ In some areas, insurance is optional, which I used to keep the costs down.  Insurance for bikes is also often quite a bit cheaper than cars, though in my case the insurance was higher than the payment on the bike.

+ Groceries are a pain.  I used to load up my arms by inserting them into the handles of plastic grocery bags to the point I could hardly steer, and then strap the rest to the back, fill pockets, whatever.  It worked, but was not fun.

+ Taking a date on a motorcycle is fine a few times, but eventually you wish you had a car.  I personally will never ride on the back of someone else's bike, I think that's nuts.

+ Driving on snow or ice is extremely difficult.  I managed to get home in 1 foot of snow once, but I had to keep my balance with my feet and it was not fun.  Consider a bike useless in heavy snow, and very dangerous when there is ice or other slippery surfaces.   

+ With proper clothing you can ride in below freezing temperatures, but keep in mind you need a LOT of layers to make up for the added wind chill.  Also avoid snow and ice like the plague.

+ Spend money on good safety gear, and keep your bike in top shape.  Wear a helmet - and don't be one of those dorks who's too vain to wear one.  You can see fine in a good, safe, full-face helmet.

+ Because of all the gear you need to put on, and the process of starting up the bike and such, I found it to be not quite as easy and convenent to just ""hop on and go to the store"" like it is in a car.

+ I STRONGLY recommend you take a motorcycle safety class such as from the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.  There are a lot of myths about motorcycle safety, and how to be safe, and what gear to buy, and so on.  The Motorcycle Safety Foundation will help you cut through the crap, and I believe you can now get your license by simply completing the class (or maybe that's just in some states): http://www.msf-usa.org/"

t3_bm8xk,AskReddit,8,0, transportation ,"Well in the US system lobbying has grown to become somewhat of a dirty thing, but it serves a purpose.  

In many political systems, proportional representation is used.  This means that it is possible for a variety of special interests to be elected into office.  They are then free to make coalitions after the fact.  Like minded interests make a coalition and depending on how powerful they are they influence the blocs to push their positions into law.  The head of state is also usually selected by this coalition which eliminates makes a general election for the highest spot unnecessary.

The difference in the USA is that we have single member districts (SMD).  And the President is directly elected.  (well there is an electoral college but it traditionally follows the public vote.)  Because of this, any coalition building is done before an actual election.  PACs, Lobbyist, Private donors etc is the mechanism in which these coalitions are built.  It is impractical to have all interests run their own candidate for two reasons.

One is structural.  In an SMD the winner takes all so unless you have a very compelling issue, your candidate would never be able to compete with a general candidate.  Especially if he is recognizable to the public.  Naturally when 51% of the vote ensures victory two dominant parties will develop to compete.  Any third parties will tend to be assimilated into an existing party with an implicit agreement to influence that parties policies on their issues of import.  

The other reason is practical.  The country is huge.  TV time, gatherings, transportation are expensive.  A general candidate needs to appeal to a vast constituency.  This takes lots of money.  It is not federally funded so private institutions and citizens must step in.  Lobbyists represent specialized voting blocs and by supporting a campaign they are essentially joining a coalition and making the candidate more viable.  These donations solidify a pre election coalition and two competitors emerge.  Usually they have around 90% of the vote locked down through their coalitions and fight for the remaining 10% of the undecided votes with the money from their supporters.  Without the money from these groups they could not compete in an election and all of the top spots in government would be taken over by those with name recognition but little loyalty to their constituency.  People like Will Smith, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Moore, Ryan Seacrest would be able to beat out nearly any unfunded political candidate.  

So with that in mind lobbying in theory is the act of forming a coalition among groups like labor rights, gay rights, abortion, environment, war industry etc.  The theory is that all else being equal the one with the broader appeal will raise enough money to where the size and logistics of an election are not the issue and the voters can make a decision on a vetted candidate beholden to their coalitions interests.  Being beholden to your coalition is essential but also seen as a dirty thing, but it can be a check against nepotism, incompetence or outright fraud.  After the election the winning parties are in power and their coalition is already decided upon.

Of course there are problems.  Mainly because not all people participate in campaigns.  And the groups that do do not compete equally.  Some contribute far more relative to their importance to the population and others far less.  It is not perfect but there is a reasoning behind it and removing the lobbying and campaign donation system without a solid replacement to move in immediately would likely wreck the entire system.  Plus those entrusted to reform it are the very people who benefit and thrive in this environment for better or worse."

t3_bm0mq,politics,1,0, transportation ,"Just so you know for starters, I think this is a good discussion and I'm not one of the people downvoting you.

&gt;But when the federal government isn't intervening everywhere(with limited power) there's less power anyone holds over you. Businesses don't lobby people who can't help them.

The problem I have with this is that power isn't just wielded by the government, and economic power can be used to exploit just as much as government power in many situations.  Take the example of what happens with many migrant workers that work on farms here in the US.  They're paid so very little.  They don't have enough money for housing or transportation so they live in bunkers on the farm that the farm gets to count as part of their pay.  The farm also sets up a store for the workers to buy their food at, because the workers are so poor that they cannot afford transportation to get from the rural area they're in to go anywhere else to shop.   If you can see where all of this is going... it's basically serfdom purely through economic exploitation, and it happens without the government doing anything.

&gt;Beyond that, trying to guess at the power structure using today's percentages of wealth concentration is an exercise in futility. I will admit however, that it is a big issue figuring out how to de-regulate without getting taken over by those who benefited from the regulation (those that are ungodly wealthy).

Breaking down by the numbers doesn't make sense really because there's so many other factors that play in, I'll agree there... but there's still no doubt that the 10% that controls 85% of the wealth does control a disproportionate share of the power.

Regulation is all over the map.  There is regulation that favors the wealthy, but there's also regulation that protects the poor.  I obviously don't think that regulation that tilts the scales to favor the ungodly wealthy is good regulation.

&gt;Ah this is truly a topic to itself.

It is... and the healthcare industry is one where there are plenty of regulations that favor the ungodly wealthy and needlessly raise costs, so I think there are plenty of specific measure that you and I would agree on there...

but...  just think of an unregulated healthcare market as a whole that was left to the markets/consumers to sort out.  What would happen?  Well you're correct that costs would certainly go way down, but they certainly wouldn't go down to the point where everyone could afford the healthcare they need.  In a free-market healthcare system, it will pretty much always be the case that those people that need the most extensive treatment will not be worth providing it to from a profit point of view.  When people get chronic illnesses that require lots of treatment, it's not extremely rare for the cost of somebody's treatment to exceed $100,000 in a single year.  Letting the market take over the entire system would certainly lower that cost, but not to the point where your average person is going to be able to afford it should they contract an expensive form of cancer or something along those lines.

Really, the most reasonable but still market-based solution is exactly the one that this bill that was just signed enacts, in my opinion.

t3_bm4wq,gaming,4,0, train ,"Mmmm I'm not too sure about that.  You bring up some good points, but there's a few thing you've not considering.  First of all, and this goes without saying, but EVs are attributes which give bonuses to a Pok√©mon's stats and improve differently depending which Pok√©mon they defeat. These bonuses, in the form of effort points, are gained in addition to bonuses gained by increasing level. A Pok√©mon which increases in level using a Rare Candy instead of battling does not gain any EVs, making it weaker than a Pok√©mon who increases in level normally.

Roughly speaking, defeating fast Pok√©mon increases Speed better than fighting slow Pok√©mon, defeating Pok√©mon with high hit points improves HP more than defeating Pok√©mon with low HP, and so on. For example, fighting 100 Machop will improve a Pok√©mon's attack stat more than fighting 100 Abra of the same level, whereas the Abra will improve the Special Attack stat more. For a list of the effort points that Pok√©mon give away on their defeat, see list of Pok√©mon by effort value yield.

Chikorita is a small Pok√©mon, primarily a pale green color with darker green accentuations on its plant portions. It has a large head in proportion to the rest of its body, with large red eyes that appear to have no pupils. It has four short legs with a single nailed toe each, and a small tail. It‚Äôs most distinguishing feature is the large leaf on the top of its head, which is usually longer than the rest of its body. It has a ""necklace"" of small green buds around its neck.

Chikorita, like many Grass Pok√©mon, are very docile. It prefers to avoid fights by using the aromatherapeutic properties of the large leaf on its head. It spends most of its time sunbathing, although it is unclear if this is because it needs to photosynthesize, or if it is because Chikorita is cold blooded and needs to warm itself up. It appears to be sensitive to changes in its environment, and can use the leaf on its head to help purify the air around it. Chikorita are also sensitive emotionally, and become very upset when misunderstood.  Chikorita are rare Pok√©mon mostly found in large open plains or small forests with other Chikorita, Bayleef, and Meganium. They prefer warmer climates.

A clock tower was built at Westminster in 1288, with the fine-money of Ralph Hengham, Chief Justice of the King's Bench.[7][8]
The present tower was raised as a part of Charles Barry's design for a new palace, after the old Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire on the night of 16 October 1834.
The new Parliament was built in a Neo-gothic style. Although Barry was the chief architect of the Palace, he turned to Augustus Pugin for the design of the clock tower, which resembles earlier Pugin designs, including one for Scarisbrick Hall. The design for the Clock Tower was Pugin's last design before his final descent into madness and death, and Pugin himself wrote, at the time of Barry's last visit to him to collect the drawings: ""I never worked so hard in my life for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all the designs for finishing his bell tower &amp; it is beautiful.""[9] The tower is designed in Pugin's celebrated Gothic Revival style, and is 96.3 metres (315.9 ft) high (roughly 16 stories).[10]

Digimon started out as a digital pet called ""Digital Monster,"" similar in style and concept to the Tamagotchi. It was planned by Wiz and released by Bandai on June 26, 1997. The toy began as the simple concept of a Tamagotchi for boys (as Bandai was also the creator of the Tamagotchi). The V-Pet is similar to its predecessors, with the exceptions of being much harder and being able to connect to fight other Digimon v-pets. Every owner would start with a Baby Digimon, train it, evolve it, take care of it, and then have battles with other Digimon owners to see who was stronger. The Digimon pet had several evolution capabilities and abilities too, so many owners had many different Digimon. In December, the second generation of Digital Monster was released, followed by a third edition in 1998.[1]

A new generation of DigiDestined, composed of three new children, as well as Kari and T.K. from the first series, are given a new kind of Digivice known as the D3, which allows them to open a gate to be transported to the Digital World through any computer. Another advantage was Armor Digivolution, using a device called a Digi-Egg (not related to the Digi-Egg that defines the earliest life stage of a Digimon) so their Digimon can evolve in the presence of Control Spires. They eventually stop the Digimon Emperor, Ken Ichijouji, thanks to the sacrifice of Wormmon, Ken's partner.

Generation III completely overhauls the effort value structure. Effort points are now separate values from the base stats. Defeated Pok√©mon give out 1, 2 or 3 effort points to a particular stat, depending on species (see list of Pok√©mon by effort value yield). However, in battles that do not give any experience (such as in the Battle Tower or if the Pok√©mon is level 100), Pok√©mon will not gain any effort points. At level 100, a Pok√©mon's stats will be one stat point higher in a specific stat for every four effort points gained in that stat.

In Pok√©mon Adventures, Chikorita is the last of the three starter Pok√©mon to get a trainer (in an interestingly similar fashion to Treeko never getting its rightful trainer until Emerald steals him as a Sceptile, much later than the other two starters had). It escapes from Professor Elm and follows Crystal until she decides to accept it to her team, where it had to pass a test. Crystal's Chikorita wears a star pendant, formerly owned by Smoochum, who accepted Chikorita when its trainer did. It later evolves into a Bayleef to protect Crys from a Larvitar, then into Meganium during a fight with Lugia along with the other two Johto starters (whose trainers had been in a coma for weeks from their defeat against the Masked Man). Crys nicknamed it Megapon.

The Cox Furniture Store (also known as the Simonson Opera House or Edwards Opera House or New Baird Theater) is a historic site in Gainesville, Florida, United States. It is located at 19 Southeast First Avenue. On June 10, 1994, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

t3_bm8he,self,2,0, subway ,"I don't know if any of these would have resulted in my death, but I would have definitely been seriously injured in most of these situations.

1) I was 15 and walking to the subway after school let out to catch a ride home.  I get to a particularly big intersection where cars are waiting for a light to turn green.  I walk down past the last car on my side of the road since the entrance to the subway was down across the street a bit.  I look to my left and don't see any cars coming.  I look to my right and see that the light just turned green.  I start to make a run for it before the cars coming from my right make it across the intersection.  As I step out into the street ready to run full speed I hear a horn blast from my left.  I freeze as quickly as I can, arms out standing on my toes (think Neo from the first Matrix avoiding the train), as a huge diesel pickup truck barely misses me.  The guy actually ended up running over my toes and I got hit in the side by the mirror (lucky it was the folding kind), but it happened so fast I didn't realize it at that moment.  He screeches to a stop before the second set of tires runs over my feet.  I'm still standing but in amazement that I'm okay.  Guy gets out of the truck asking if I'm okay.  As he's asking I actually apologize to him and keep going across the street.  My toes were pretty sore for about a week, but otherwise I was completely fine.

2) I was 17, coming back from the movies with my gf at the time.  I was driving a 1990 dodge caravan that was a piece of shit.  I remember it being a particularly nasty rainy day.  I'm driving and go up a hill that has a light at the bottom, probably going about 50 mph in a 35 because I was trying to pass a guy.  As I'm coasting down the hill I see the light turn yellow.  I probably had about 3-400 yards before the light so I lightly touch the brake...nothing.  I press it harder, nothing.  At this point I'm freaking out in my mind thinking what the hell, still going 50, towards an intersection that has cars going through it now.  I put the pedal all the way down and finally feel the brakes start to work.  I barely stop before the light.  I see the brake light come on as if I had just put the parking break on.  Confused I kept driving for another 20 minutes in stop and go suburban traffic until we got to my parents house.  I park the car, tell my dad about the light, and he says he'll take a look at it in the morning.

Turns out the brake lines had a hole and there was no brake fluid in the lines at all.

3)  I'm driving home on another rainy day in a 1999 corolla.  I don't remember me driving particularly fast or anything but I do remember the tires at the time weren't the greatest.  I'm on a highway that I'm not familiar with and take an off ramp for an exit I need.  I approach the off-ramp a little fast and tap the brakes to slow down.  This particular off-ramp had concrete barriers on both sides all the way down with maybe 5-6 feet of clearance on either side of the car.  As I tap my brakes I feel the back wheels lose traction and I spin a full 180 degrees amazingly not hitting either concrete barrier despite this off ramp being curved.  My car realizes that the tires start going backwards while I still have it in drive, and the engine auto-shuts off.  I'm now facing the completely wrong direction on an off ramp with a turned off car and see an 18-wheeler start to head down the ramp.  I try to keep cool, put the car in park, and turn the key.  The engine takes about double the normal amount of time to turn and I throw it in reverse and start to go backwards down this off ramp.  Luckily I make it to the bottom and pull off while people are looking at me because I'm facing the completely wrong direction than I should be.

I never realized all my close calls had to do with cars until now.  Weird."

Here's a bit of history about copyright that not many people know:


England used to have a problem with the Stationer's copyright. In the 17th century, Bloody Mary chartered the Stationers' Company to act as a censor for the state. It was a time of a lot of Catholic-Protestant Tension in the country, and was likely used to oppress the speech of the Protestants (Mary was a Catholic). In exchange for acting as censors for the crown, the charter granted any individual who was part of the Stationers' Company an exclusive right to publish a book that he registered *in perpetuity*. Authors were banned from joining the Stationers' Company. In effect, authors were unable to copyright their own books, and the publishers had a never-ending, exclusive right to publish the book.


Fast forward a bit: Bloody Mary dies, is replaced by (Protestant) Elizabeth, the Glorious Revolution comes, the Star Chamber is replaced by Parliament. It's the end of the 17th century. The Stationers' Company keeps pestering Parliament to renew a charter that had, for the better part of the century, granted them some additional powers. Parliament doesn't like them much, and is fed up with listening to them. And so in 1709, when the Stationers' Company is petitioning Parliament *again*, Parliament throws down the gauntlet: the Statute of Anne - the first modern copyright law.


The Statute of Anne makes two important changes. First off, it vests the copyright in the *author* instead of the publisher. Second, it reduces the copyright term from *forever* to 14 years, with a 14-year option to renew at the end of the initial period, if the author is still alive.


Fast forward again: the end of the 18th Century; the fledgling United States. The founders are well aware of the problems of the Stationers' Company and want to avoid perpetual copyright. They also recognize, though, that encouraging artists to create ultimately leaves us all with a better society. That's where the Constitution's copyright clause comes from. Art. 1 ¬ß 8: ""The Congress shall have power to . . . promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.""


Congress figures the Statute of Anne strikes the right balance, and so in 1790, we get the first Copyright Act in the United States: it has the same 14-year term as the Statute of Anne, with the same optional 14-year renewal. It makes registration of a copyright a fairly expensive and difficult process, and it applies to maps, books, and navigational charts.


Let's compare that to copyright today, after 200+ years of bloating copyright power:


**Copyright Terms**
&gt;**1790:** 14 years, 14-year optional renewal

&gt;**2010:** Life of the author +70 years


**Copyright Subject Matter**
&gt;**1790:** Maps, books, charts

&gt;**2010:** Virtually any conceivable form of art or creation that requires creativity and isn't covered by trademark or patent law.


**Method for Securing Copyright**
&gt;**1790:** Submit a copy to the local federal district court, submit another copy, within 6 months of publishing, to your secretary of state. The work must bear a notice of copyright, and upon publishing, you must run advertisements in a sufficiently large local newspaper for four consecutive weeks, letting people know you copyrighted your work.

&gt;**2010:** Nothing at all. Copyright is automatically applied to every single piece of copyrightable subject matter as it is created. No notice of copyright is necessary, no filing, no advertising. The only catch is that if you want to sue for damages, you have to register it with the Copyright Office.


Copyright is out of control, and the Supreme Court and Congress are to blame. Consider some of these statements:

&gt;Actually, Sonny wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever. I am informed by staff that such a change would violate the Constitution. I invite all of you to work with me to strengthen our copyright laws in all of the ways available to us. As you know, there is also Jack Valenti‚Äôs proposal for term to last forever less one day. Perhaps the Committee may look at that next Congress.

*--CA State Rep. Mary Bono, speaking of the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA; named after her husband)*


&gt;The purpose of the bill is to ensure adequate copyright protection for American works in foreign nations and the continued economic benefits of a healthy surplus balance of trade in the exploitation of copyrighted works. The bill accomplishes these goals by extending the current U.S. copyright term for an additional 20 years. Such an extension will provide significant trade benefits by substantially harmonizing U.S. copyright law to that of the European Union while ensuring fair compensation for American creators who deserve to benefit fully from the exploitation of their works. **Moreover, by stimulating the creation of new works and providing enhanced economic incentives to preserve existing works, such an extension will enhance the long-term volume, vitality, and accessibility of the public domain.**

*--Senate Report 104-315, explaining the official purpose of the CTEA (emphasis added)*


(N.B. the CTEA extended all copyrights, then existing and future, by 20 years, and is the act that saddled us with the current life + 70 years term.)


...because terms that can easily run 140 years (i.e. guy creates work at 30, lives to 100 - that's 70 years - and then another 70 years) are great for improving the public domain and our shared culture, right? Think about that: if we'd had these 140-year terms all along, right now, *today* we'd be getting public domain works that were created in *1870*. In 1870, there was no electricity, no car, no airplane, no internet, no movies, no recorded music. And yet those works would *just now* be entering the public domain.


But if you think Mary Bono and her ilk are just some wingnut politicians who are in the minority and pose no harm, consider this: the CTEA retroactively added 20 years to all copyrights in existence when it went into effect. This means the rational behind the Copyright Clause didn't apply; those works were already created, and so simply tacking another 20 years onto their copyright duration could not possibly serve to encourage their creation. Furthermore, a retroactive extension of copyright served to set precedent for Congress: they can go back, at any time, and extend old copyrights. That, at least arguably, violates the ""limited time"" provision of the Copyright Clause. And after the CTEA was passed, a group of companies - represented by Lawrence Lessig - sued over just that issue in *Eldred* v. *Ashcroft*, 537 U.S. 186 (2003). And writing for the 7-2 majority, Justice Ginsberg wrote:


&gt;Guided by text, history, and precedent, this Court cannot agree with petitioners that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress' Copyright Clause authority. Although conceding that the CTEA's baseline term of life plus 70 years qualifies as a ‚Äúlimited Tim [e]‚Äù as applied to future copyrights, petitioners contend that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not ‚Äúlimited.‚Äù In petitioners' view, a time prescription, once set, becomes forever ‚Äúfixed‚Äù or ‚Äúinalterable.‚Äù The word ‚Äúlimited,‚Äù however, does not convey a meaning so constricted. At the time of the Framing, ‚Äúlimited‚Äù meant what it means today: confined within certain bounds, restrained, or circumscribed. Thus understood, a timespan appropriately ‚Äúlimited‚Äù as applied to future copyrights does not automatically cease to be ‚Äúlimited‚Äù when applied to existing copyrights. To comprehend the scope of Congress' Copyright Clause power, ‚Äúa page of history is worth a volume of logic.""

*--Id. at 186-187.*


Or the tl;dr version:


&gt;So long as Congress doesn't extend copyright using specific language like ""forever,"" they're free to extend it as much as they want, so long as they do it for a fixed number of years at a time.


So, anyway, long story short: stop blaming the lawyers. It's stupid and insulting. Blame your politicians for failing to grasp the Constitution and the purpose and function of copyright. Blame your Supreme Court for torturing language to more or less the same ends.


Copyright law, as it's structured, doesn't have any party in the process who stands up for the public. This is the result: 200 years of out-of-control copyright expansion leading to laws that people cannot and will not follow. This is hardly ""the lawyers'"" fault."

Anyway, here's my recommendation.  I've thrown in a bunch of sidetrips (marked with a star) which you may want to not do if you don't have the time.

Start in Bangkok

* Side trip to south Thailand, catch ferry to either Koh phan ngan or Koh Samui, back to Bangkok

* Side trip to Kanchanaburi.  The waterfalls at the arawan national park are beautiful.

Get your Vietnam visa now before leaving bangkok for the final time.

Bangkok to Chiang Mai, take overnight train and book in advance.  If trains are booked, the bus is about half the price and can be done in half the time, but it's a tad bit more uncomfortable and much less scenic.  CM is a very lovely city, see the tigers, elephants.  There's also cock fighting and lots of muay thai shows.  have a spicy papaya salad.

Bus to Nong Khai (~12 hours).  Optionally: stop in Sukhothai, splitting the bus ride into two 6 hour trips.  Nong Khai is a wonderful northern thai city settled on the mekong river with lots of bbq and clubs.  see the buddha garden/park.

Bus to Vientiane, you can pick up the visa at the border; bring 35-50USD to pay for it.  Vientiane has some pretty sweet temples and awesome massage shops. 
Bus to Vang Vieng.  Traditional backpacker trail.  If you want happy shakes and/or opium tea this is the place to get it.  BE CAREFUL OF PLAINCLOTHES COPS, I can't stress this enough.

* Side trip to Pohnsavanh.  See the famous plain of jars, one of the most bombed regions in the world.

* Side trip to Luang Prabang -- I never went here, but a ton of other backpackers did..dunno what all the hype is about.

Back to Vientiane (bah! sorry!), but all buses from north lao run through here as a hub.

Bus to Tha khaek.  See the buddha cave, and * if you're adventurous, check out the 1km long river-cave.. It's like 40km out of tha khaek so it's not particularly easy to get to.

Bus to Pakse, as a stopover.  See whatever you like...haven't been personally ;)

Bus to Si Pan Don (4000 islands).  Enjoy the awesome atmosphere.

Bus to Siam Reap, get visa on arriaval.  You know what to do here.

Bus to Phnom Penh.  

Path 1: To go Sihanoukville and check out [the happy hippi](http://www.happyhippicambodia.com/).  Then into Vietnam via Ha Tien.

Path 2: Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh.

I haven't been to vietnam yet, so I can't say much about it (I'll be there in about 1-1.5 months) but the basics would include nha trang, da nang, vinh, and ha noi.  

You could fly out of ha noi.  

I've been traveling a year and flown four times times (US-&gt;London, Turkey-&gt;Egypt, Egypt-&gt;India, India-&gt;Thailand) for a total of 1400$.  I don't know how that compares to RTW ticket prices.

My favorite cafe in Prague is called Dobra Trafika, it's in the Vinohrady neighborhood.

If you like partying, you may want to check out Ostrava.  It's a city in the Czech Republic's far east, nearly on the Slovak/Polish borders.  There's a street downtown there called Stodolni street, which has roughly 90 or so pubs/bars/discos/etc.  My favorite might be the Amsterdam Coffeeshop, Medvedev, or Barney's.

Other cities in Czech that are amazing: [Jindrichuv Hradec](http://www.zamky-hrady.cz/3/img/jin_hradec_centr_let.jpg)  Has the third largest castle in the country, behind Prague and Cesky Krumlov, respectively.

[Cesky Krumlov](http://leto.in-pocasi.eu/cesky-krumlov/cesky-krumlov2.jpg) is a gorgeous, quaint little medieval town which has been kept in good shape.  If it looks familiar, you've probably seen it in the film Hostel.  There's a gypsy bar here that is AWESOME.  

Beers to drink: obviously Pilsner Urquell.  Go to the bar and say jeden Plzen, prosim (yeden pullzen, proseem).

Staropramen.  Brewed in Prague.  Fucking delicious.

Radegast.  Harder to find around Prague, as it's brewed in Nosovice, which is closer to Ostrava.  This one is my favorite though.

Gambrinus.  Heaven, in liquid form.

LAST BIT OF ADVICE: You will pay up to 5 times more for food, drinks, anything within the 'old city' area of Prague.  Venture out into the neighborhoods to get food, alcohol, souvenirs, etc.

you might not be aware that orthodox judaism, while making explicit certain segregations of the sexes and providing specific roles, is also very respectful to both sexes. in religious communities, men and women are expected to dress and act in a certain way. elsewhere, the attitudes are more relaxed. taking a story about a violent incident on a bus as indicative of a prevailing culture is fairly ignorant.

the story about the woman being removed from the photograph speaks mostly to the disconnect between the orthodox religious groups and the rest of the country- the religious are being fed images to placate them meanwhile women are assuming positions of power. i found it quite offensive that this story was written up in the same article as a televised public flogging, as though the two are comparable."

The farm also sets up a store for the workers to buy their food at, because the workers are so poor that they cannot afford transportation to get from the rural area they're in to go anywhere else to shop. If you can see where all of this is going... it's basically serfdom purely through economic exploitation, and it happens without the government doing anything.

The government allows migrant workers/illegal workers on farms because it is economically impossible to do otherwise.

First, understand migrant work for what it is; a black/gray market created by the minimum wage. While I could argue it in that terms, I feel like I'd be glossing over the more 'true' Libertarian view for something more acceptable to Liberals. So I guess the second answer is:

You can rely on humans to act in their own self-interest. They are working their by choice. They are coming here to do migrant work because they(often rightly) believe doing so is going to benefit their lives. Perhaps not to the level a full, non-migrant ""American"" job would benefit them, but it's obviously better than the alternative in their mind.


A few notes though on the more concerning of the abuse you discuss: 

* By the very nature of hiring (generally illegal) migrant workers, *the company is not going to be able to keep them in indentured servitude.* They can't allocate debts to illegal workers, and illegal workers don't give a shit about their credit rating. Probably don't even have one.

* The way I see it, you are discussing not just a problem, but a market niche to be filled.Don't like the way these guys are being treated? Then  *buy some goods, pay one of them to sell them there for a fair price*. Or circulate lists for bulk orders from Costco. Mark it up enough to make it worth the time it spent, but don't be unfair. If the abuse is truly as concrete you describe, you will not only be doing a good thing, but can earn a living from it.

&gt;Breaking down by the numbers doesn't make sense really because there's so many other factors that play in, I'll agree there... but there's still no doubt that the 10% that controls 85% of the wealth does control a disproportionate share of the power.

Agreed. Though Libertarian philosophy doesn't espouse that power should be equal. Just that power/money/reward should be the fruits of your labor.

&gt;Regulation is all over the map. There is regulation that favors the wealthy, but there's also regulation that protects the poor. I obviously don't think that regulation that tilts the scales to favor the ungodly wealthy is good regulation.

There's a few problems here:

1) Even legislation that is legitimately intended to protect people ends up having far reaching implications. Even things like raising the minimum wage ends up just making goods cost more...generally proportionally to how much more workers are making.

2) Most legislation that would be considered ""good"" is patching up legislation that is ""Bad"". For example: The Glass-Steagall act is frequently cited as an example of legislation it was bad to repeal. I agree with this when looked at individually...but at the same time recognize the entire need for Glass-Steagall is based around the need to patch up problems that result from the banks interactions with the Federal Reserve. So while Glass Steagall is approaching a legitimate concern, it's only necessary because of previously botched legislation.

3) Most things that ""protect consumers"" appear good on the surface, and are pressed for hard by large companies. Lawyers are mother fucking expensive, and the cost is used to crush smaller companies before they get going. And the ""regulatory"" organizations have large incentive to do it - after they attack a certain industry and eventually leave the regulatory institution(in my cace the Federal Trade Commission), they then become *very* high priced lawyers for the very people they were going after.

&gt;but... just think of an unregulated healthcare market as a whole that was left to the markets/consumers to sort out. What would happen? Well you're correct that costs would certainly go way down, but they certainly wouldn't go down to the point where everyone could afford the healthcare they need.

I disagree. Right now the reason insurance companies are so abusive is because you don't have a choice. No one really does.

When prices of the underlying care drop and people have an option, Insurance will have to cut *more than the price drop of the care* to get customers back. When the only thing they can provide that can't be taken care of out of pocket(at least after flat-rate doctors/lower pharma prices are around) is catastrophic care, and many are willing to go without catastrophic care coverage they have to actually have catastrophic care that's worth it.

The price drop of the actual care isn't the ""ends"", it's the ""means"". When people have a viable(though more limited) choice *to* insurance, the entire game changes. They have to make a product worth buying.

As long as you see health care as something that is pseudo-mandatory, or that ""everyone should have"", you lose *all your power* in that business transaction. That doesn't mean everyone can't have it or shouldn't have it...it just means that the perception of that surrenders all your power. Why would a company do things that benefit you if they know you dropping them isn't even an option?




&gt;In a free-market healthcare system, it will pretty much always be the case that those people that need the most extensive treatment will not be worth providing it to from a profit point of view. When people get chronic illnesses that require lots of treatment, it's not extremely rare for the cost of somebody's treatment to exceed $100,000 in a single year. Letting the market take over the entire system would certainly lower that cost, but not to the point where your average person is going to be able to afford it should they contract an expensive form of cancer or something along those lines.

I'm going to revert to the basics on this rather than dive head-on into health care(if you're interested in health care specifically, [I talked about it more here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/birea/socialism_like_the_ancient_ideas_from_which_it/c0mzawv)).

Ok. So If you're paying $100,000 for a year of treatment, you have to be paying for something. To look at it as a Libertarian is pretty easy.

Everything that makes up that $100,000 is a case of supply and demand. For every single dollar spent, there is a good/service being supplied, and a demand being filled. If you want that price to drop, you need only figure out which supply is costing so much, and why it's being limited. There's obviously a demand for everything there, and the fact that the supply hasn't risen to match it means something is interfering. Find out what's limiting that supply and get rid of it. And prices will fall."

In Alberta for example, you have the choice between Bell, Telus, SBS (Formerly Bigpipe), Allstream (MTS), Navigata (Sasktel), not to mention a whole host of Tier 3 providers that can get you started when you don't need 100 mbit unmetered.
 
The physical linking itself usually just means setting up a few repeater towers (~50km apart) to get you to a larger urban centre where you can get fibre access to one of the big telcos.  You'd be surprised where they have fibre point-of-presence though, sometimes the town itself will have it even if there is nobody providing consumer Internet service from it.
 
Alberta has a provincially-financed network called the ""Alberta Supernet"" that reaches every town big enough to have a library or school.  Personally I don't like it, they charge enormous amounts for transfer, and it's almost always cheaper to build your own links back to a major centre than use theirs.  But I suppose for the extremely remote communities it would be the only feasible option.  The supernet also doesn't give you Internet gateway, it just gets you transport to a centre that does (Edmonton or Calgary), and you still have to pay for gateway once you get there.  The whole thing is really a big cash cow for Bell, who operates it and gets special privileges for doing so."

I'm sorry you're at this point; it means you didn't manage to teach her money sense when it would have been easier for both her and you.

Obviously you love her and know she's not a bad person- just really self-absorbed and oblivious to the world around her.

Good point. In light of that, my ideas on the subject sound a bit like hollow excuses. Perhaps I should explain that better. My brother almost went away for dealing. So I guess that I should say that I *can* relate, but not in the usual manner. 

&gt; While I may be able to give you my opinion, I'm sure it's nowhere in line with anyone else's...

An excellent and understandable reasoning. As I spent a good portion of my time in Portland, I grew up in a completely different genre. I listened to Punk (Bad Brains and Bad Religion, not Blink 182) for a good period of time and completely shunned any form of rap or hip-hop citing my dislike of the stereotypical white guy who thinks that he's black. After some time, I realized that it's best not to judge something by how other people feel about it.

I moved onto Elliott Smith and other melodic music. I was introduced to it while attending the Art Institute of Portland the summer before my senior year in High School. Quite a number of my new friends loved him, so I eventually got into it too. I do genuinely like the music, but I never would have got into it; so I can relate to your reasons.

As for looking back at past music, I don't have that same situation. Before punk, I listened to Classic Rock and older exclusively. I like to tell people that I grew up with my finger on the pause button of my tape deck, surrounded by my father's vinyl. It's hard to peer back on the likes of Tom Petty (no matter his simplicity) and Dylan and feel disappointed in your taste. Not that I'm talking myself up, I just grew up in good company, musical taste wise.

&gt; It's not even a positive ratio. I can deal with being down overall. What sucks is that you post a comment, and people don't reply to it.

Yea. I'll admit that I've done this in the past. I don't rotate around like you mention, and I try not to be offensive in my disagreement, and I certainly won't downvote for opinions, but I still feel guilty here. So I suppose it's a good thing that I decided to actually discuss it with you. I feel that I've got a better understanding of the music. To a degree. I still hate it, but fuck, my Mom hates Pink Floyd, that doesn't make them awful. 

&gt; I would be curious as to what you listen to in terms of rap.

Well, I mentioned De la Soul, but I mostly intended to imply that I listen to music that stemmed from their movement.

t3_bmbr9,AskReddit,108,0, bus ,"We were you three years ago.  Our daughter was nineteen, intelligent, artistically talented, extremely easy on the eyes.  Nothing interested her. Well, she liked art, manga, writing. But didn't DO that. She waited until the last day to apply to Truman(in MO) she was not only accepted, but was offered the presidents scholarship based on her ACT and SAT scores(through the roof). 
 Our frustration with her since puberty began was how little effort she put in to anything.  Grounding, taking her books away, no media. Nothing mattered, she'd make do with less. No books? she wrote fan fiction(instead of homework). She didn't seem to want anything enough to work for it. She would just lower her standards. She had two accidents while still on a drivers permit. So she opted not to get a license. She still expected rides to work. We too considered Military school when she was 15. She wasn't a trouble maker, she just wouldn't DO anything.
We were relieved she got the scholarship, but it drove home her life lesson that she could coast and the world would conspire to offer her a free ride.
She had a very fun first year away at college. When she lost her scholarship, we refused to pay for school and she came home.  We stressed that if she was no longer a student, our health insurance would drop her. She didn't mind. She got a waitressing job in walking distance of our house and walked or bummed rides from co-workers.

Our breaking point was finding two dime bags of weed out in the open in her room.  I have heard repeatedly that ""it's only weed"". I had a sister who was a junkie. We have a NO DRUGS rule in the house. To make that more of an inflexible rule, our youngest child has autism and a sensory integration disorder. He puts things in his mouth. We could not risk drugs in the house.
On the night we found the pot, we told her she'd have to sleep elsewhere that night and we'd talk in the morning.
I know it was a little late for ""tough love"". But the next day when we discussed the terms of her re-entry into the house, she blithely told us that she and a girlfriend were getting their own place. (so long and thanks for all the fish).
For the next 9 months I saw her very little. She transferred to a different restaurant. She lived in the city(of St. Louis) took the bus to work, walked to the grocery store, fought with her roommate.  Drank and smoked. But boy did she work hard. Paying the rent meant working a lot of hours, having no insurance meant riding out that upper respiratory infection and still bussing to work. 
I worried constantly.  I pictured muggers and rapists in every alley. The hardest thing we ever did as parents was to let her fail. And that is what did it.  Failing sucks. She didn't like it.  Once we stopped shielding her from natural consequences, she started thinking about what she wanted. And working for it
She fell in love with someone, and in the spring they got an apartment.  She got her drivers license. She applied to community college part time and used all her charm to get them to accept her despite her abysmal first year grades. She aced every class. She and her mate are now pre-approved for a mortgage and house shopping. They've been together over 2 years.  She just made the leap from wait service to an office job(for a country club) and has health benefits.

You have to let go of your daughter. You raised her. She is grown. Stop cleaning up after her. You can't be her safety net and expect her to actually take responsibility for herself.  It's going to hurt. Both of you. It's necessary. 

I see this a lot. I grew up in poverty. I was thrilled to be able to provide my daughter with great schooling, clothes, car, privileges. I protected her. That was what I wished for as a teen. It's what I gave her. It's repairable, but it means more than just stop paying for stuff. It means if she screws up with the law, you don't clean it up. If she opens credit cards and screws up her credit, you don't save her. If she gets thrown out of school and can't get in to another, you don't go in there and do battle for her. It is HER life. All of it.

Our daughter was angry with us for about 18 months, then angry at her self for another year.  But she's succeeding now. And even better, she is no longer so narcissistic, or self absorbed...or reckless.

With all the tech companies now there, and the workforce there, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, etc. are becoming more important destinations than the ones on the east side of the South Bay.

Like you, I live in a rural area and know that attitudes you've described very well. You've made a very interesting point: generation &amp; upbringing are a feature of our society; attitudes and norms change, and (by definition) clash with the old ones.

For what it's worth, I think Marogian is about right: the old attitudes *will* gradually die out (compare attitudes to race and sexuality in urban Britain now with the 1970's) but that in the meantime, the *law* shouldn't make concessions to bigots.

That's the law. On a personal, more human level, we should be a bit more tolerant of these intolerant people, for the reason you've explained. And in doing so, we should try to make them aware of changing times, and urge them to think about their *own* place in modern society.

It's worth noting that our sympathy for people like this tends to be proportional to their *intent*, more than the language they actually use! I've seen this again and again - friendly-but-awkward &amp; unwittingly anachronistic questions to black people; not knowing where to look when two women walk into the bar holding hands... frankly, that's not too bad.

t3_b9voo,ILiveIn,2,0, transit ,"I lived in Nashville for 3 years, up until late 2005, when I moved to MD to finish my undergrad.  I basically went there for no reason in particular, I just sorta felt like getting off of the greyhound that day.  From my experience, it's easy to meet good people and there's always work to be found if you're looking.  The music scene is really integrated into the local culture, and there's a lot of good music to find there.  Plenty of pubs and entertainment far away from the tourist's radar, but a ton of touristy stuff to do as well. 

The public transit is of typical quality for a US city of its size, and the regional interstate setup is decent.  Easy to get completely across town without much impediment.  And the airport is one of the more pleasant/ones I've found in the US.  I think its a hub for Southwest so I always found cheap flights from BNA.

Regarding housing, I always found housing to be a non-issue when compared to similar US cities like Seattle, Portland, etc.  Basically I always found decent places at decent prices.  Certain areas of town are rather undesirable though, regardless of how inexpensive a place might sound.  Also, it's cheap to drive in TN as well;  super-easy inspections, cheap fees and all that.

If you're considering Vandy or Belmont, you'll be around West End which is probably the most exciting part of town.  Most of what I consider positive aspects of Nashville are concentrated in West End and the 'near' East side.  "

t3_bmapw,pics,5,0, train ,"Rather than squelching the biting behavior you might consider learning to control it trough training. A bite for a dog can be a cheap, pleasant reward. Look into finding a trainer that has a background in a dog sport called french ring. German Shepherds and Belgian Malinois are common breeds for the sport. (I don't do the sport myself but a trainer that I worked with to train my dogs is into it.) 

They teach bite work for the sport and the dogs learn exactly what they can and cannot bite. If you were to approach a trainer with the goal of getting a K-9 Good Citizen certificate (very basic obedience) and get some help with a German Shepherd puppy that really likes to bite you might find a sweet combo with a french ring trainer.

Professional one on one training is a great investment in your puppy. I never thought of doing it till I had a problem integrating a second dog into our household.

Ayesee's confusion of say and same makes me wonder.  Let's assume his story is mostly true from his perspective, does anyone really think obscenity directed at police officers advances the cause of liberty?

Now anything he claims just looks like petty retaliation for a probably warranted arrest (inebriated friend tossed from bar, he had drinks by his own admission and swore etc.).  

As for your general take on ""the police""--police officers are actually individuals and they vary greatly as do departments and policies.

t3_bmdtw,politics,34,0, station ,"It annoys me when people assume that the poor don't have a strong ""work ethic."" Lets say someone works at a gas station full time. They 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year. They do a good job, show up on time, work hard, and go home tired. They make $9.00 an hour. I'd say that person has a hard work ethic. I'd also say that person only makes $18,000 per year.

Now here's the thing. For our society to function, we *need* people to work those jobs. We say things like ""if you don't try hard in high school, you'll end up working at a gas station,"" but the truth is that for our society to function, we *need* gas station workers. We need cashiers at the grocery. And we need them to work for cheap so we can continue to afford our lifestyle. Even someone who tries hard in high school, if they don't have the financial support of their parents to work in college, they could well wind up working in a gas station. And there is no shame in that, they fill a vital role in society. And their salary is no reflection of their work ethic. So the option comes down to either paying more for your gas so the worker can afford things like health care, but that would hurt people *like* the gas station worker who also need to buy gas. It inherently regressive. Or we can let those who have come into wealth through the opportunities that those with hard work ethics who only make $18,000 have provided by supplying cheap labor help those who have allowed for their success.

In summary, it isn't fair to say that someone who can't afford health care or their home doesn't have a strong work ethic. It is true that many impoverished people have poor work ethics or money management skills, but that doesn't mean that everyone who is poor has a weak work ethic, and it doesn't mean everyone who has a weak work ethic is poor."

Included are the exercises for each day, the number of sets to do for each exercise as well as the number of repetitions to try to do.  

If you see a rep range of say 10-12, that means that you want to be struggling to accomplish that 12th rep.  If it is too easy, increase the weight you are using.  You will want to strive for progression.  Progression can come in the form of more weight, or performing more reps (within the prescribed range).  I have also included links to pictures/videos/descriptions of the exercises.  Ok, on to the program.

For all days and all exercises, perform all sets of each exercise before moving on to the next one.  Rest periods in between sets should be 60-90 seconds.

DB Standing Calf Raises: 3 sets x 12-15 reps
http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Gastrocnemius/DBStandingCalfRaise.html
- In your gym you can try standing on the foot pegs of the decline bench.  It looks like it is elevated a bit and has a rubber plate so you won't slip.  When performing the calf raises you want to hold the stretched position at the bottom for a few seconds.  This will force the muscle to work harder and negate the elastic rebound effect from your achilles tendon.

Day 7: 
Rest

I know that right now you are running a lot.  It is counterproductive to run 4 miles 7-8 days in a row if you are trying to gain muscle.  You can ignore this advice and continue to run that often but it will make it nearly impossible to accomplish your goal.  

On the days where it says rest or cardio, if you choose to run keep the cardio to a maximum of 40 minutes.  With this much training it is also important to have one day where you don't train at all.  

You have a good start.  Your body is in good shape and with some hard and smart work you can accomplish your goal of gaining some muscle.  I do however think you need to be realistic, your thighs might have some fat on them right now but they aren't *fat*.  Your quads/hams/glutes have a pretty good shape right now that can be improved/emphasized through weight training.  Increasing muscle mass will help to burn more calories and decrease body fat but remember females always have a bit higher body fat.  TLDR, you are probably a lot closer to having a 'toned' body than you think.

Good luck and post any questions!  I'll be sure to check back.

She totaled her car again? Oh noes....but you aren't going to take care of it for her. Don't fix it yourself and don't pay for the repairs, either. It has to come out of her pocket. Also, she needs to pay for her own speeding ticket, and if she's got any fines to pay for having a suspended license (I don't know how that works; I've never done that) then she pays for that, too. If she doesn't have money, too bad for her. She can walk, bike, or ride the bus - also with her own money. If she doesn't have a job, help her write a resume and send her out to find one. Oh yes, and don't let her drive without her license. You know what else I'd do if I were you? I wouldn't ferry her around. If she asks for a ride, remind her of what happened with the car and the ticket, and tell her she'll have to make some other transportation arrangements, because you simply can't do it. That will hit home. It won't take long for her to miss her car and realize how much it sucks when you're careless.

If she wants to go back to college, don't pay for her. Let her take out a student loan and work for it herself. I think she'd work harder if she had to pay for it. And if she chooses not to go back, she has to get a job.

Don't give her any more money. If she wants to go out for lunch with a friend, she pays. If she wants a new outfit or some other thing, she pays. If she has no money, she goes without, no matter how much she whines and complains. Only get her stuff if it's her birthday or some other special treat. The rest of the time, she's on her own.

Also, make her more responsible for her stuff at home. Don't do her laundry for her. Don't clean up her messes or even pick up her clutter from around the house. Don't let your wife tidy her room, either.  ; )  She needs to be responsible for herself and her stuff. Anything damaged or lost is replaced on her dime. 

Time to get tough with her. Usually stopping the flow of cash will be pretty effective. ; )  Good luck! And don't give in, no matter how much she tries to manipulate you or guilt you and no matter how sincerely she screams ""I hate you"". "

edit: OK.  Due to these downvotes, I will try to explain.  Firstly, an [inward-heelflip](http://www.board-crazy.co.uk/tricks_i.php#inwardheel) is one of the absolute hardest tricks to perform that do not require multiple flips or rotations.  Now the reason why he was able to do it, was that he uses the crutch to flip the board rather than performing the very involved footwork that would be required.  Secondly, getting the air required to land on the rail makes that already very difficult trick much harder.  Now he has no problem getting up there because he plants both crutches on the ground and lifts his body up rather than having to hop off the board without using the ground as leverage.  Lastly, the landing would be easier when you stop yourself from falling either direction by once again using the crutches as leverage.  In summary, these are kinds of tricks that x-games champions perform in their memorable freestyle runs.  Not 12 year old skater kids(unless they have crutches).

For the record I did upvote this video when I first saw it and if this kid is really crippled I think he is doing a great job of making the most of what he has.

I pay $740/month for a one bedroom with balcony, but I don't know if that has changed. It did not go up when I resigned my lease last time, so it should be about the same now. Two bedroom apartments are around $800 I believe if you plan on having a room mate.

My advice, train it like you've never trained any animal before. Shepherds train ridiculously easily, so its fun and easy, but still requires commitment. A dog like that you can't really control physically, even if you think you can, you can only control them with willpower and good training. Next most important thing after training is dominance, these animals will try to gain any advantage over you they can, they have the brains and wits to do so. Its not like you need to be mean or anything, but it is extremely important they know who is boss. Never feed it from the dinner table, never let it sleep on your bed, always make it wait for its food, etc.

t3_bmbr9,AskReddit,2,0, train ,"**Hi**. I'd like to offer some advice that goes against what a lot of Redditors are saying.

Don't cut her off. A lot of people are saying (and will say) that you should cut her off. Don't do that. Basically, she's fucked if you do that. More importantly, you love her, and you feel a responsibility to her as her parents.

That doesn't mean you should keep funding her lifestyle. You should wean her off. 

I didn't quite catch if she is still in college or if she has moved back home. If she is in college but failing, stop paying for it. If she isn't disregard that last statement.

If she is living at home, keep her there. She will wind up a lot better in the long run if you help her than if you boot her out.

These are just ideas, but here is what I would do if I were you: 

* Freeze her credit card(s). She doesn't get them anymore. She will whine, complain, and say she needs them. She will give you convincing arguments as to why she needs them. She will tell you she needs them in case of an emergency. These arguments are persuasive, but she *doesn't* need a credit card. If she has an emergency, she can call you for help. If she needs a tow truck, you usually can pay when you pick up the car, or they sometimes take your credit card number over the phone.

* Give her all money in cash. Make her justify every every expense. Be reasonable. If she wants 10 dollars to go to a movie with friends, give her 10 dollars, but not too often. She can't go to the bar, movies, restaurants, etc, every single day. Once a week or so seems fair. If you do this, you can say ""no."" If she has a credit card, she doesn't have to have your permission to buy things, but cash limits how much she can spend and what she can spend it on.

* Quit letting her buy excessive or expensive clothes. By this, I don't mean cut her off completely. Make sure she has a sufficient supply of undergarments, socks, potential work clothes, and casual clothes. But do not let her buy any fancy clothes. If anything costs over $25, she doesn't need it. If she wants fancier party clothes, make her look in the thrift store.

* Ask for receipts.

You get the idea. Don't let her live a lavish lifestyle. Make her justify her expenses, and only provide her with cash, so you know how much she's spending and what she is spending it on.

* Make her keep track of everything she spends. Tell her she has to keep a ledger of all money you give her and what she spends it on, and she has to have the receipts to match it. Keep a ledger yourself so you know how much she's costing you. Make sure they match. Show her how much she costs every month.

* Make consequences. If she crashes a car or gets a moving violation, she loses car privileges for a month. If she's getting her gas money in cash, then you can easily restrict that.

At some point, she *will* have to provide for herself. You could potentially...

* Inform her that after 3 months time, you will make her responsible for 1/4th of the money she spends, so that will have to sign a contract saying she will pay you back for 25% of every dollar you give her after that point.

* Inform her that in 6 months time, she either has to have a plan to got to school to train for a career, or be employed. Tell her you are more than happy to help her get a job by providing transportation, clean work clothes, and so on. You are more than happy to help her go to school if she will try this time, so long as she keeps her grades up and is going to school for a purpose. If she has not applied for jobs or applied/made plans to apply for school, you stop giving her any money. You will still feed her and house her, but she gets *no* money.



I'm not trying to be pushy. These are all just suggestions. It is just one possible course of action if you want to help get your daughter ready for the world, but don't want to cut her off or kick her out because she wouldn't make it on her own yet.

Either way, good luck to you. I hope you and your spouse can get your daughter on track to live a normal, healthy, independent life."

Its simple: You say, we wont fix your car, you have to do it, you must fix your mothers car, you broke it, you break a car and can't pay? you ride the bus like the rest of the world. Princesses don't understand consequences, make her understand there are consequences and they are hers to own. "

An engineer has to make critical decisions and often has to work incredible hours to get projects done on time and right. Being wrong could have incredible consequences and in many engineering professions a chunk of your free time is spent keeping up to date on the latest trends/certifications/etc. A gas station attendant just has to show up for the hours required.

Her ovarian cyst will probably be able to be fixed with lots less invasive surgery today than would have been required 10 years ago-- and so recovery should be lots faster.


I've had eye problems myself: went near blind with cataracts and had to have both lenses replaced; but I'm doing OK now. So there IS hope of getting back to a normal life again.


Maybe if you can afford it, you two might plan a vacation trip for sometime after she's completely recovered from everything? Give her something to dream about through the near term rough spot.

My first pair was the Bose noise-cancelling headphones.  They DO NOT sound good at all.  Please don't get noise-cancelling headphones.  Please.  At best, they interfere with the audio.  At worst, they make you feel sick.  I sold this pair after I realized I never listened to music with them because the cancelling made me queasy.

My second pair was a set of Grado SR-80s.  These sounded good, but they were uncomfortable on my ears.  The deal-breaker was that one ear-piece shorted out only four or five months after I bought them.  The other side shorted out soon after.  Sure, it's probably an easy fix and Grado probably has a warranty for me, but I just don't want to deal with a product that breaks in such a fundamental way and so quickly in the first place.

I've had this pair of Sennheisers for two or three years, use them all the time, and they're still going strong.  They're cushy and comfortable around my ears and sound extremely natural.

The stress levels can be HUGE, which IMO is completely relevant to the pay scale difference between jobs.

If you work in government you generally favour the Liberals or NDP because your job would be perceived safer - so your government friend has a reason to characterize the CPC to you as the party of the rich - with a negative connotation.  The CPC wants in general to shrink government, freeze government wages, etc...

If you look at Marx's theories, he differentiated between use-value, and exchange value. The use-value of a person who works that hard at a gas station or is the best janitor they can be gives quite a great use value to society, but since we now have people in wage slavery and capitalism is festering around the world, the exchange value, that is, how easy it is to find someone else to do that same work for them is much lower.

As long as we let capitalism continue, even if we ""regulate out all the problems"", this will still happen. People who work the hardest at their job will not see the exchange value of their labor go up more than the market will dictate. This is why we propose destroying capitalism in its present form, and replacing it with a system we deem better, namely Socialism. Most people in this thread seem to be of the idea that it is unjust and shameful that people that work that much still can't keep a roof over their heads, or food on the table, or keep themselves healthy.

Also, for our Christian redditors, remember what Jesus said. ""That which you have done unto the least of these among you, you have also done to me."" If we treat the lowliest and least of our society as animals unworthy of health care and continued life, we're also doing the same thing to God. We cannot, therefore, as people who profess to say they follow the teachings and words of Jesus Christ, that we have no responsibility to help these people.

I respect this idea. It is the path most middle-class Americans have taken to find success. You get a job in high school, working at a gas station or a grocery. You go to college or trade school with the money you earned, some loans, and/or some help from your parents.
The problem is, I don't think it's a realistic scenario for everyone. People who are born into poor families face severe disadvantages that make it much more difficult to bridge this gap.

First off, we face the reality that poor children that live in poor areas go to lower-quality schools than those who live in middle and upper-class areas. From the starting gun, they're starting farther back from the starting line.

Let's take a look at a very realistic hypothetical of a teenage student, without even including anything like children or dead spouses or parents or so on. Lets even say the kid works hard, his parents help him with his homework, and so on. The rest of his school is behind him, and even if he gets A's, he still hasn't been afforded the skills to succeed in a post-secondary situation because the other kids were holding the material back.

Say their parents didn't have much money and weren't around because they had to work. They had to get a job as soon as they were old enough just to pay for their own clothes. Besides going to school, they also had to work just to be able to keep clean clothes on their back. I know people will say things like, ‚ÄúBut we have things like Social Services to protect children from families who can't take care of them,‚Äù but the reality is that these programs only help children in the most extreme cases.

So we get this kid, he's working a job at whatever the legal age is as many hours as he legally can, and all his money goes into helping pay for his cost of living expenses. In addition to his 8 hour school day, he also has to work. His school work will suffer. This says nothing about his work ethic. It is entirely related to his situation. Beyond that, his parents probably aren't around to help him with his homework, and he may have responsibilities to take care of his siblings. Even if this is because of his *parent's* lack of work ethic, *he* is suffering because of it, and so are his future opportunities. It says nothing about his work ethic. In fact, his work ethic and sense of responsibility is stronger than most of his peers, but he isn't as capable of academic success as they are. Basically, up to this point, he was deprived of  a real opportunity to go to college.

But wait, once he graduates, he can get a job and work his way through college, right? Well, maybe. But maybe not.

Lets say his parents kick him out when he is 18, as soon as they legally can. He has a bag full of clothes, and has to get a job. He gets a job at a gas station. Works as many hours as they will give him. Even if he *can* work for years and make it to an affordable college, he then has the difficulty of both working and going to school simultaneously. He won't be able to go to the best colleges, his grades will suffer because of difficulties of balancing his work (which he can't afford to quit) and school. He's behind his peers who had better advantages. When it comes time to get employment with his degree, he might not be able to. Even working as hard as realistically expected, he's still behind the people he went to that post-secondary program with. They will get employed before him. 

That's setting aside things like the current unemployment rates and economic situation. Right now, I read that there are about 8-10 unemployed people for every 1 available job. That means that people should take whatever they can get. But if our hypothetical gas station worker just finished trade school to be an auto mechanic, there are thousands of recently laid off automechanics who can fill the jobs before him, and then the students who did better than him in mechanic school will get the remaining jobs before he does. In fact, his balancing of school and work puts him behind most of the future graduating auto-mechanics classes. There is a good chance that even though he worked his ass off to afford to go to auto-mechanic school, he might never be able to get a job as an auto-mechanic. 

Now, that's not to say that no one can work their way up. That would be foolish of me. But that doesn't mean that it isn't much harder to work your way out of poverty than it is to get by. Even of the people who try as hard as can reasonably be expected, some will still fail.

&gt; You are completely wrong, poverty in the U.S. is entirely related to work ethic. 
I'm not going to make any personal attacks on you or your statements here. But I think that work ethic explains *some* instances of poverty, not all. I wouldn't say it is ‚Äúentirely‚Äù related, at least not in all cases. Even for those who work as hard as possible to escape poverty, only *some* of them will. But I think it is unfair to leave those who try (and express tremendous work ethic but fail to succeed) high and dry.

&gt; Does he deserve medical care? Yes, as long as he can pay for it. If he cannot pay now, he must make a solemn promise and sign a contract that he will pay for the care when his situation improves.

But then we reach a problem. What do we do if he makes that solemn promise, but then his situation never improves? The rest of us are forced to absorb the costs, right? But one of the problems is even with a situation like this (and this is how emergency room visits function) where people have to get care in exchange for a promise to pay for it later, is that they will try to tough out medical problems instead of getting the care they need because they're worried about paying for it later. We need a system where people are encourage to see the doctor when they notice a lump or a mole or a rash or an infection and can have it treated early and cheaply with mild surgery or medications, rather than requiring things like chemotherapy or amputations at a later date. In some cases, preventative medicine is not cost-effective in the long run, but in other cases, it is *very* cost-effective. It depends on the situation. We need to make sure our system encourages people to get medical care rather than wait until it is too late (or is much more expensive to do so). Making people ‚Äúpromise‚Äù to pay for their care in this sense is dissuasive towards this aspect.

&gt; OP respond to this for me. Why must a doctor, a nurse and all the others needed be forced in to providing this care for free?

I'm not saying the doctors and nurses shouldn't be paid. I never said that. In fact, to be quite honest, I don't think I even mentioned health care in my original post. All I said was that poor work ethic is not necessarily the cause of poverty, and that many factors can contribute.

But moving beyond that point to the argument you brought up, I think doctors and nurses should be paid. To be honest, I think *some* (emphasis on ‚Äúsome‚Äù) doctors are overpaid. Getting a finger reattached, for example, can cost $40,000. The procedure takes something like 2 hours. The actual material cost including hospital facility maintenance, medical equipment, and drugs runs somewhere in the $1,000 range. The rest goes to the doctor and the hospital. (All numbers from a recent conversation with an HMO doctor). Many surgeons, after 5 years experience, can make in the $700,000. I think *they* are overpaid, and their services should cost less. But I don't think most physicians (who make about $150,000) and nurses (who make about $60,000) are overpaid. But I don't want to debate that point. That would side track the argument extremely quickly.

What I do think is that everyone has a right to life, regardless of their financial situation. Someone who works 40 hours a week should not be denied medical care because they cannot afford it. If we have to tax those that can afford to pay for those who cannot, I think we should do so. I'm not talking about taxing people who make $80,000 a year. I'm talking about taxing people who make $500,000 a year. People whose livelihood won't be damaged.

&gt; Why must the man who has escaped poverty be forced to sacrifice for the man who has not escaped?

The thing is, I don't think the man who has escaped poverty should be forced to pay for the man who has not. Most people born into poverty will not escape it. And realistically, almost all who do will only be lower-middle or middle-middle class. If they make it to the point where they are making hundreds of thousands of dollars, then they can afford it.

&gt; Have you ever considered that your help may be hurting people? Have you ever considered the spoiled child of a rich man? What difference is that spoiled brat to the man you wish to spoil?

I think, more importantly than just providing services, such as health are, we provide opportunities. We don't just give people a handout, but we give them a hand to help them up (Sorry, that was cheesier than I meant it to be). If that means better education, more scholarships, so be it. If we have to help someone  by giving them medical care so they can focus on other aspects of their life, I think that is a good idea.

But more importantly, you have to think about the fact that no matter how hard someone works, if someone that started better-off than them works just as hard, the one that began worse-off will almost always remain worse off, save for tragedy striking the advantaged individual.

But I learned to wake up precisely by practicing waking up. The basic idea is to recreate the situation exactly as it is when you wake up, and then get some batting practice with an alarm. So if you're me, make the room dark, turn on the fan, and put the dogs on the bed. Set the alarm for 10-15 minutes after you tuck yourself in. You're supposed to use that time to relax, chill out, pretend you're sleeping. When the alarm goes off, fly out of bed and get dressed, try to imitate as much of your morning routine as you can. Repeat 3 or 4 times daily. But make sure you do it every day. You should notice the difference after the first day of practice."

A couple problems with this view.

Firstly, your typical 15-22 year old student not only is completely occupied from 9am to 3pm, they are quite often occupied several hours afterwords due to their involvement in extra-curricular activities or more importantly: studying and homework. In order to be worth the hire, the student will have to work around 20 hours a week that WILL cut in to study time.

Second, ignoring the fact that students, regardless of their diversity, almost universally have a block of time ranging from 9am to 3pm that they cannot be scheduled, they are also notoriously hard to schedule. Be it finals, a basketball game, a school trip, hanging out with friends, students have a mostly deserved reputation for being unreliable.

&gt; Oftentimes these workers have a difficult time finding work b/c older people that never made something with their lives are doing the jobs the students could/should be doing.

There we go with stereotypes that your OP is attacking. Just because an older person is working as a cashier at a gas station doesn't mean they never made something with their lives. Maybe they're a recent immigrant? Maybe they got laid off and can't find any job openings in their former industry? Maybe they're an ex-con struggling to make the most of their second chance?

Ok. So it's alternate reality where something akin to scientology is followed secretly by government elect, who are all celebrities voted in because of voter stupidity (In the lines of Schwarznegger). The story starts out with the public stupidly happy, but with growing signs of oppression; cover ups, political assassinations, etc. The protagonist is a journalist who is trying to expose the cult behind the government, probably from a society that has already collapsed, and can see the signs here. Let's say an educated asylum seeker from Israel.

One day, he comes home to find his home under armed fed arrest. He is confronted, but manages to run away. His family is captured however. He then falls in with mercenaries, as they pick him up when he's lost in a shady area. They confirm some of his suspicions: the government is using mind control chemicals to keep the populace sedated and happy, and that there's something darker behind scenes. He also learns the identity of who ordered his family's arrest.

Goes to where his family are held, which is a giant government citadel thing, witnesses fatal experimentation on his family (turns out to be psychic, but he only finds this out later.) On a revenge trip he destroys a psychic reactor with some of the mercenary's gear.

The reactor starts melt down, and he escapes in a thrilling underground bullet train after some absolutely crazy fighting. Then you've got the psychic fall out (like that bridge sequence in WitB), and it turns out that the reactor actually was the main suppressant for the populace. Naturally with it gone, all hell starts to break loose. There's no organised rebellion, just anarchy.

Making his way through the street gangs, the protagonist learns that the heads also survived the blast, and boards their air convoy, which is heading north. At the arctic, there is a large facility overseen by a contemplative AI. Helping a prisoner there escape, he learns about the psychic projects of the government, and how this is linked with their cult.

Something big comes up, and the entire facility arranges itself into a psychic amplifier. The culmination of the government's work is approaching. And the twist? It turns out the government were vying desperately to amass enough psychic potential in order to save the species from some kind of warp death (predicted by the AI), which is bearing down that very night. This is revealed just as the protagonist has the device sabotaged and the antagonist at gunpoint.

The warp starts, and the protagonist's latent psychic powers are awakened, and the extracted power from millions of sacrificed psychics manifests itself onto him, turning him into something god-like.

This blessing of power also becomes his curse, as he is left immortal as the world perishes.

My point is that your payment has nothing to do with your ethics, considering that most of one's payment derives from the difficulty, time taken and profitability of one's job as to their employers.

The cover law is because whether there's a load in the back or not, in a commercial truck there's _usually_ enough debris from previous loads that (without a cover) it'll fly loose on highways and fuck up other drivers' windshields.

Also, the insurance company isn't who you should be calling to verify your vehicle's status; you should be calling the state Dept of Transportation or similar (whichever agency you go to to register the truck in your state). If it is indeed registered as a Commercial Vehicle, bitch about until you can convince someone that the truck isn't actually a commercial vehicle and that the registration is in error.

Also, inform the municipal court you're supposed to appear at that you intend on contesting the ticket (or whatever it is you need to do in your state to go to trial), show up, and contest it. BEFORE THAT DATE, make sure the registration is transferred to non-commercial. Have a friend tow you to a local weighstation if that's what it takes.

t3_bmgwj,TwoXChromosomes,6,0, train ,"&gt;Though in no way do I harbor the opposite opinion as you, do you look at the gender disparity in relatively high-paying but life-threatening jobs (construction, mining, military) and propose similar quotas to force/allow women to work there?

Interestingly, you're hitting on one of the causes of the much ballyhooed pay gap, the fact that male dominated professions- even ones considered blue collar- pay a good deal more. Some, like the ones you mentioned, are also considerably more life threatening which accounts for higher male occupational mortality rates.

But to answer the actual question, the reason for quotas in many of these jobs is that they are very powerful positions that have a broad societal impact. It is for this reason that that there is an active effort to get more women and minorities into, say, police departments. Having them in those 'positions of authority and prestige' has a powerful salutary effect on the life chances and economic/social success of those groups, as well as the society as a whole.

Secondarily, a quota to make 40% of your corporate board female is doable. There are enough competent women in that part of the labour force. But for *mining*? That isn't going to be possible.

&gt;If someone promoted me from my technical engineer position to a top executive job because my company needed more bisexual athiests represented, I would gladly take it. It doesn't mean I deserve it, or that I would have otherwise wanted to work to achieve that level of 'power.'

I'm going to tackle this and the next quote simultaneously because they hit on a very significant issue that does need to be addressed in discussions like this.

&gt;I am wondering how you feel about the qualified people who lose their jobs to make room for the quota? Collateral damage for the greater good?

The other part of the Zero Sum myth I outlined in my prior comment is that a mythically competent phenom of a white male is being necessarily displaced by an otherwise mediocre woman or minority for the sake of a diversity quota.

It is the presumption (from internalising the oppressive aspects of our culture) that the white men who *are* presently running corporations and governments are preternaturally talented and have earned their station by sheer merit and naught else. It is the Horatio Alger story writ large and powerfully on our imaginations. It's also entirely false. You could very reasonably argue we're actually *plagued* by the incompetence of the powerful at the moment.

Being unacquainted with the Norwegian elite I cannot provide explicit examples from Norway. But I can provide a welter from the US and Iceland.

Most Americans (and probably a good deal of the world that is able to follow international news) remember Michael ""heckuva job"" Brown who came to symbolise the cronyism of the Bush Administration; the famously unqualified ex-head of FEMA was only the tip of the iceberg. Gaggles of people, mostly white men who were part of the president's milieu, found themselves promoted to jobs they would've otherwise been unqualified for solely on the basis of connections and political views, or donations rendered to the president's campaign.

To continue with the US, ambassadorships are famous gravy trains that do not reward competence but rather the size of one's wallet. To become the American Ambassador to France one must simply be a part of that privileged elite (in which it is overwhelmingly likely one will white, and more than likely male) that makes sizeable personal donations to campaigns. This is not an office for which talent with diplomacy is required.

Or to look at the fathers of our present recession. Whither the storied competence of the people (who with only a few exceptions) were men, and predominantly white, who ran our banks? Whither that great talent for which such exorbitant bonuses had to be paid? It seemed to do them precious little good, certainly very little good for the economy.

It's not confined to America either. Let's head a little closer to Norway, where we began. Iceland; their own financial meltdown has a riotous story all of its own complete with 'Vikings', the derisive name given to the men who ran Icelandic banks (into the ground). Many protests were lobbed at the executives of these corporations who many now argue, quite correctly, nearly gambled away the future of their island nation.

Given the spectacular financial failures of the past two years (with roots stemming back years or even decades) it is hard to argue that our present system is merely rewarding talent, drive, and competence. The Economist (which was an ardent defender of the idea of absurdly large bonuses, even when their disbursal was at its most farcical in early 2009) is not eager to face up to the reality of the world occupied by their most devoted readers, one of unearned privilege masked by a veneer of meritocracy.

So. That was a jolly long rant. The point? The assumption you're making, that most or all of the people at the tops of these organisations are talented and competent and being asked to hang their hats to make room for *in*competent women is largely false.

Companies are being forced to adhere to their capitalist principles (rewarding merit) and find which men are really their best of the best, and which are just riding the gravy train of ""daddy worked here"" or ""I golf with the boss"" or ""my family is friends with the owner of this company.""

I would also suspect that there would be some natural turnover (retirements, et al.) in the period since the law was passed that would have enabled companies to find seats to give to talented and deserving women.

However...

&gt;if it happened to me, I'd hope at least to get a big severance package.

This being Norway, I don't think that'll be a problem. ;) Interesting how that works, a social safety network that benefits *everyone* (up to and including private corporations being quite generous with benefits and severance) helping to grease the wheels of equality."

* [Ravel - Menuet from Le Tombeau De Couperin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egDqJWKZmVE)- Another beautiful melody. I'd also recommend the fugue and prelude from this set (Le Tombeau) though the prelude may be a bit difficult depending on your ability. Still, it'd be a worthy challenge :). 
* [Liszt - Sposalizio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdzaMUw98pc) - a bit of a difficulty jump here from the last piece but worth the challenge IMO.
* [Traditional Chinese Music - Autumn Moon over a Calm Lake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IPXsqez0zg) - I've actually never played this so I don't have a particularly good sense of how difficult this is. It's really pretty though!.
* [Ravel - Sonatine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L302PJFsQ-g) - Good introduction to keeping two hands in proximity to each other without getting in each other's ways.
* [Liszt - Les Jeux d'Eaux](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADQKl6adDgU)- Extremely enjoyable piece, so easy to get lost in all the water feels.

After these, there are a ton of more difficult pieces out there that are really enjoyable. I guess it's pretty hard to rank these so I won't really try.

* [Liszt - Dante Sonata](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QeT2gwC64w) - Amazing heaven/hell contrast IMO, great to play.
* [Liszt - Benediction of God in Solitude](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuDF4Rn_dFM) - Only piece to ever make me cry in exultant tears :s. I only learned the first half though, it's quite long.
* [Ravel - Ondine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F-TaxA4YQg) - One of the pieces I most enjoy playing lately.
* [Ravel - Jeux d'eaux](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_36x1_LKgg) - Plan on learning this next.
* [Ravel - Toccata from Le Tombeau de Couperin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbX6NFTyjZw) - Very difficult, can be like a runaway train at times but amazing piece.
* [Ravel - Scarbo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pFsMqVr3B8) - I'm learning this piece right now. It's a lot of fun.
* [Liszt - Sonata in B Minor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSGUkvIHXLw) - Huge piece, hard to describe. Give it a listen I guess :s.
* [Liszt - Mazeppa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hlt5LWMKb4) - One of my favorite endings that I've encountered.
* [Kapustin - Toccatina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1VbN3Nlrxk) - Very unique rhythm.
* [Liszt - Totentanz for solo piano](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDzKzxCO2xM) - Very difficult piece to do justice.

t3_bmecp,politics,0,0, station ,"&gt; Capitalists only pay for productive labor. No one would pay someone a wage to perform the kind of labor you describe.

Good. You've started to see my point. Labor alone doesn't mean anything. It has to be labor that gives some value and produces manifestly more value with increasing skill. Your average gas station attendant is payed little because, even if he is the most skilled gas station attendant in the world, he isn't going to produce much more value than a new attendant. His skill is marginal at best and has very little effect on his overall contribution to the gas station. It only has a noticeable effect when it is bad, and the situation is easily remedied by hiring a new attendant.

&gt; So only ""skilled"" jobs are allowed to remain? I can think of many so-called jobs that require unskilled or semi-skilled labor, and yet are essential to the functioning of society. Additionally, being skilled does not necessary equate with necessity in society. High-volume Wall Street traders or affiliate markets are ""skilled"", yet produce zero social value.

What is skilled and unskilled changes with time. Being a master weaver used to be a highly skilled job. Yet not one cries in their milk now that most weaving is done by machine with minimal human supervision. We moved on, and everyone's living a far better life now that a majority of our populace is not tied up in trivial labor.

Also, to answer your first question. No, ""skilled"" jobs aren't the only ones allowed to remain. They are the only ones that you should expect to be paid grandly. If you want to waste your time weaving when it is no longer a skilled labor, go right ahead. Just don't insist that the rest of society support you in a middle class lifestyle for your foolishness. These jobs aren't meant to be the primary income of a wage-earner. They are a good starting point for an unskilled worker who hasn't attained a marketable skill yet. If you're still doing a job like that in your middle age, don't throw a hissy fit about the unfairness of it all. You have only yourself to blaim.

&gt; Nobody is advocating a Luddite-esque position like you describe. If anything Socialism champions technological advancement. Ultimately, it frees the working class from the yoke of tedium. When the working class is producing for it's own benefit rather than that of some capitalist, don't you think it would be in the best interest of the class to reduce the expended amount of time needed to produce a particular good or service? If you ever bothered to actually read any Marx or Engels, you'd know that.

The Bolsheviks never advocated for mass starvation when they took over Russia, but it was a result of their policies. Socialists can claim all they want about their support for technological advancement, but what they really want to do is steal the advancements that have already been made by a system that they claim to despise and pass them around, whilst killing the system that created those advancements. It's like me saying that I'm for cows. I'm for cows, because I want to take them all from the farmers and give them to my friends to eat. How we'll make new cows after we've eaten all the others is part of the glorious plan that we're going to work out in the workers paradise.

To give you and example of the kind of idiocy that socialist thinking brings about, I'll mention one of Chomsky's pet stories. He loves the factory reclamation movments in South America. To him, this is a glorious victory over the capitalist overlords. One of the factories that was reclaimed was one that made fine china plates. Before the workers stole‚Ä¶ahem‚Ä¶reclaimed‚Ä¶this factory from the capitalist overlord, they would keep most of the profit for themselves. Now the factory workers share all of the profits. No one is more equal than the next. They're all making about $200,000 a year from making these china plates.

Of course, the the machinery that makes the plates is valued at 70 million dollars, and the workers have no intention of paying for it, and they have no understanding of how to fix it, and they'll probably bitch and moan when the company that researched, designed, and built the machine demand some money in exchange for their expertise, and \*gasp\* they may actually want more than what it just costs to fix it, because they decided to go to school and take hard classes to become engineers, whilst some ignorant fuck in the middle of the jungle with a 5th grade education thinks that it's a lot more fair that they earn $200,000 a year living off the corpse of a greater civilization.

So yeah, you can say that you are for technology in the same way that I'm for engines, but I fucking hate gasoline. The fact of the matter is that the capitalist economies of the world vastly outpace the socialist ones in terms of innovation. Before you sing the praises of socialism, let's do an honest experiment. Let's build a wall between the capitalist countries and the socialist ones. Let's make it so that no one on either side can utilize the inventions of the other. Then we'll see which people are doing absolutely better in after 100 years. I should probably mention that the MRIs that your socialist states need for medical treatments‚Äîthat's ours."

As best I can. Its a matter of supply and demand. We learned it in economics 101. The larger the supply, the lower the demand, the lower the price. There are far more people who can occupy the gas station attendant position than can perform brain surgery than can be depended upon to make baskets in the final seconds of a championship basket ball game. Its neither skill set nor work ethic. Its a matter of supply and demand. There was a pharmacist shortage not long ago..and we're still suffering from it. Pharmacist wages increased dramatically. (Their working conditions plummeted and they are worked like dogs) Though the path to these positions required enormous foot work. 
It is estimated that to become an expert at anything...Eric Clapton as an example; you've had to have put in some 15,000 hours of training to become a master. That's about 7-8 years 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week...the brain surgeon is far more than this, the basketball player as well. Eric has clearly put in more than that as has Michael Jordan. I would estimate that Dr Ben Carson, pediatric neurosurgeon has put in more time training than either Eric or Michael...but again supply and demand and competition.
The work ethic as I see it is more seminal than you are interpreting it. I have a 6 figure income, a 3 letter title, an advanced college degree, and a lifetime of learning dedicated to my field. I come from very meager beginnings, very sad and disturbing upbringing with much tragedy and despair. I grew up with every disadvantage imaginable. Yet I arose from this childhood which many say produces much of the crime and poverty in our society. I was an average kid in high school and an average athlete with average intelligence.So did Eric and Dr Carson. Though I'd hardly say they were of average intelligence.
How did I succeed ? Work ethic. I went to college. Couldn't get in to a major University. Started in Jr College then on to a major University. Paid for it on my own. Couldn't afford a car so I rode my bike the 13 miles to school and back home each day. Wasn't too smart so I had to re-read everything. Then I watched what the successful kids did and joined them in study groups etc. Re-read everything, used flash cards, and any other kind of memory trick I could find to get good grades on exams. BTW I had a ton of fun in college.
In graduate school, there were days when I couldn't afford to eat. I didn't ask for handouts, wouldn't be caught dead at a soup kitchen(actually I wasn't aware such things existed or I may have swallowed my pride and got something to eat), and kept my dorm room closed so I didn't have feel ashamed as the kids with dough went by after dinner. 


I made it and passed a board exam who chewed up and spit out 55% of the people taking it and only allowed 45% to pass.
I developed a serious booze problem in grad school and was given a stern warning-or else. I quit drinking. 
I have no knowledge of what was going on in the outside world for those several years as my time was spent in the library preparing for the next test or writing the next paper. I missed an entire couple of presidential administrations.


Fast forward. I chose well and have never faced unemployment. I do have a lot to do with the gas station guy and his family...and the welfare entitlement class as well. I gotta say that a common thread that I see keeping these people down is just one string of bad decisions after the next. Crapping out babies that cant afford and cant properly care for. Choosing the easier softer way of feeling good by gulping down either dope or booze or food or whatever. Most sport several hundred dollar tattoos.
Even Dr Carson says something similar """"It was during his teenage years that he ""began to understand {the key to success} through reading about the lives of successful people. They were organized and took advantage of situations. The hallmark of an inefficient person is doing the same thing over and over and over again,"" he said.""""
So I'm the guy who can afford his house, doesn't miss payments, cares for and supports his children, and volunteers to help inside a large local penitentiary.
I pay over 3 times the yearly income of the gas station guy just in state and federal payroll taxes. Extrapolate out my other tax burdens to scale. The amount I pay in taxes is obscene. 
Gas station guy likely pays little or no payroll taxes. Lets not get started on illegal immigrant-paid under the table-on welfare-and subsidized housing guy. 
Mr Obama will have to add VAT to support his health care plan...so my tax contribution will increase even further.


I know that my circle of friends from college lived a life and had an experience very similar to mine. College is very competitive. Most colleges grade on a curve. The vision of the rich kid fuck-up buying his way thru college is just not true. He'd be mowed down by the people with will power and weeded out faster than shit through a goose. Its also very expensive so my daughter in the expensive private college who pays for most of it scoffs at the idea of dropping out after investing $60k for her first two years. She got some scholarships, mostly student loans and dad is coughing up some.


So gas station guy is a product of his own choices. VoTech would have given him the skills to be an electrician, plumber, or mechanic and my last plumber made more than me...I'm pretty sure of that.
So, I support myself..pay huge taxes, pay my bills, obey the laws, contribute my time to the less fortunate, donate to charity, and have been a proud member of AA for 14 years.
So...I'm sorry if my rebelling against paying even more taxes than gas station guy pisses you off. I'm very willing to help the helpless but not the clueless. 


His work ethic is NOT the same as mine. Yes his feet are tired...but he cant be sued for a misstep, he cant cause the loss of a life for a misstep, cant cause his franchise bazillions for a misstep and so-on. Ringing up gas purchases and sodas is not a 22 hour procedure requiring years of training to separate Siamese twins. 
The secretaries, clerks, and paralegals chop a lot of wood and carry a lot of water. But my learned skill puts it all together in a way none of them could even begin to fathom and my decisions and organization effect the actions which greatly improves their circumstance. 


Those people-the secretaries, receptionists, gofers etc have made choices that ultimately lead them to their current comfort zone. Their stories are all the same after some 25 yrs in this business. They lead the same lives today as their counterparts did 25 years ago. We don't owe them anything more than the market will bear for their services...nor me. 
I know many people who were secretaries who said eff this..I can do this. Quit their secretary job, figured a way to have their child cared for and went back to college....in their 30's. MN Gov. Jesse Ventura said it: if they have the will to do college, they'll find a way.
We are in the Perfect Shit Storm right now. It don't matter if you can swim or not...it wont help much till the storm settles. I'm sorry you're an engineer and got washed overboard. Making more lifelines wont make the storm go away any faster.


Wanna make the storm go away faster? You cant. In the complexities of this shitstorm set the dynamically changing pieces of the conundrum in constant motion. 
We as a country have become very efficient as a result of technology. We're producing more with less man power. (http://www.economist.com/business-finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15731230). 
We dont have a health care problem...we have a 'who's gonna pay for it' problem. As our workforce grows and employers have provided more of the workforce with insurance...the laws of supply and demand get an artificial tweek. As health-care costs rise, the demand doesn't go down as it should...insurers continue to pay more for it so costs grow abnormally. The demand for doctors goes up and their expenses rise resulting in high costs to consumers and insurers. 


Health-care insurers are private industry and have the right to control expenses. They reduce the scope of what they'll pay for. A lot of this makes for great headlines if its stated well.  
Another artificial tweek then comes into play : tort law. Also, Big Pharma gets in there like a drunken uncle and adds more movement to the puzzle in the form of rebates on and on and on...holy fucking conundrum batman.
Einstein couldn't understand Health care costs or Health-care reform and what to do about it. Ask any health care practitioner what they think about it and all you'll see will be eyes rolling.
So...no, I don't want a value added tax ripping more tax dollars out of me to pay for something no one understands. Nor is anyone willing to publicly announce the content of the health care reform bill.  
I hate to burst your bubble...but a vast majority of the takers and consumers of government entitlements are there by choice. The helpless ? No....the clueless? um...well...hell yes they are.
Justification and rationalization are brilliant maneuvers...and if played right can move mountains. Boy if I only had rich parents...boy if you had an upbringing like I did, boy if you had the problems I have, boy if I just didn't have this booze problem I got from my daddy....

But why would you do that for buses? Buses are too small to get any tangible benefits. The improvements will do their part attracting more ridership, which in urban contexts where improved transit is at all built results in passenger volumes not easily served by bus.

The improvements, namely the expensive ones, involve street reconstruction. The cost of building streetcar support during street reconstruction is not high. The cost of building streetcar *is* the street reconstruction.

As the step up from BRT to streetcars is a very small one, it simply makes sense to skip BRT in many contexts: where the BRT might become overloaded before its design lifetime is up, having the streetcar to begin with pays for itself. For highly developed urban landscape and urban landscape that seeks to be this *will* be the case.

Please note that I'm considering the investment costs sunk to operational costs over a fairly long time span.

The company/job probably isn't worth agonising over. Your boss has proven that their business acumen is meagre. Bypassing chain of command might work, but in my experience your boss has already had a conversation and you'll have to overcome a serious framing problem to get your point across.

Your boss is attempting to mitigate their (unknown) risk by having you train your replacement. Fair enough, as far as that goes - the might even have been a requirement from their boss. There is obviously money in the budget to cover both your and your replacement's time for some overlap period. So, you go in proposing that the current deal is unbalanced, with all risk mitigation in favour of the company. You counter-propose that you bill/take home the same weekly amount you are taking now, but only spend 3 days a week training the replacement. If needed you move to 4 days. You spend the other 1-2 days face to face with other companies (line up the interviews in advance) getting your next job. It is so much easier to get a job while you're in a job. If you get something good you go.

The entire practice should be outlawed as it creates an unfair advantage for the wealthy (As if they needed another).

A young adult with wealthy parents is going to be able to work for free without any worries; their family will handle their financial responsibilities while they get in with the company. Their rent, utilities, health care, transportation costs, and groceries will be taken care of.

Even if the lower-class employee works two jobs, they're still at a disadvantage; they're going to be more likely to make mistakes due to mental and physical fatigue."

Aside from serving as the communications arm of the totally research-oriented Media Research Center, the blog network Newsbusters also serves as a perfect example of why social conservatives will never abandon their preferred premise regarding the mainstream media‚Äôs fundamental bias against the right. I myself was targeted by MRC head honcho Tim Graham just last month for having made the case that the Catholic Church has a long and sordid history of criminal activity that makes the priesthood‚Äôs collection of suspiciously sticky Tiger Beat back issues look benign by comparison; as far as I can tell, his objection was that I had said a lot of really mean things about the Catholic Church, and that this was indicative of something. Presumably, it is not indicative of anything that my anti-religious screeds never manage to make it into any mainstream publications, whereas I‚Äôm usually more than welcome to attack various institutions and individuals who don‚Äôt have massive followings permeating throughout the most lucrative magazine-buyer demos. It‚Äôs almost as if individual editors and publishers are motivated by something other than hatred for all things good and true.

Today, Newsbusters contributor Jeff Poor busts that news by pointing out that media outlets are talking about RedState founder and recently-hired CNN contributor‚Äôs Erick Erickson‚Äôs spirited monologue to the effect that he doesn‚Äôt feel like filling out his census form (and neither do I), and in fact will pull a shotgun on whatever hypothetical federal government agents come and try to force him to do so. Although I agree that it would be awesome if Erickson were to point a shottie at a group of federal agents and thereby learn the difference between Republican fantasy and harsh reality, I nonetheless feel it necessary to point out a few things to Mr. Poor here before I go back to fantasizing about that myself.

1. The headline of Poor‚Äôs piece refers to some ‚Äúwitch-hunt‚Äù against Erickson. A witch-hunt involves a bunch of people looking for something that probably isn‚Äôt there, like a witch. In this case, a bunch of people are pointing to an incident that clearly occurred and making fun of the douchebag in question.

2. Witch-hunts, incidentally, are still engaged in ‚Äì not by my crowd, but rather Poor‚Äôs fellow religious folk in certain parts of Africa, where suspected witches are still killed. Although polls indicate that about a fifth of Americans believe in witches, these Americans are apparently too lazy to hunt any witches down themselves. At any rate, it might be time to adapt some phrase that (a) applies and (b) doesn‚Äôt remind people about the sorts of things religious conservatives get down to when secularists aren‚Äôt around to hold their hand through reality.

3. Poor states that ‚ÄúPolitico has joined the fray and is taking news tips from left-wing storefronts,‚Äù by which he means Media Matters. Quick thing to think about, Poor: if Keith Olbermann went on some talk radio show and started jabbering a bunch of wanna-be tough guy nonsense about how he was inclined to pull a gun on the feds if they try to make him fill out a form that‚Äôs used to figure out how many seats each particular state ought to be alloted in the House (the bastards!), and Red State reported on it, Politico would pick it up, just like they‚Äôll pick up any potentially damaging Democratic PR move. It‚Äôs news. They report on news, particularly if it involves unusual or deranged behavior, like CNN‚Äôs decision to hire Erick Erickson over some better conservative commentator.

4. I‚Äôd like Mr. Poor to note that mainstream outlets not only pick up stories from conservative bloggers just as they do liberal bloggers, but also pick up actual conservative bloggers on occasion ‚Äì despite all of the good reasons not to. For instance, Erick Erickson is the second blogger from Red State to be picked up by a major news outlet, and he‚Äôs already not sounding as tough and uncompromising as he does in text or on some Georgia radio station ‚Äì his recent segment with Howard Kurtz should be particularly embarrassing to everyone who has a stake in seeing this fellow succeed. Now, a few years back, The Washington Post made the mistake of taking on yet another Red State blogger, Ben Domenech, as a columnist. A few days later, he was shown to have plagiarized a bunch of stuff that only a fool would have had to plagiarize. He responded with forced laughter and various half-assed excuses. Then, more plagiarism was revealed. He blamed his old college newspaper editor. Then, so much more plagiarism was found that even Michelle Malkin came out and said that the guy was guilty. Then Domenech, being a literalist Christian who got to his then-current station by way of family ties and who was such a mediocre writer that he‚Äôd had to lift someone else‚Äôs review of that Final Fantasy movie instead of just explaining why it sucked and had no relation to the games whatsoever, took one last swipe at all the nation‚Äôs non-conservatives, noting that at least they were spending their time attacking him and not America. Fellow really jumped on a grenade there.

5. In light of the above, I‚Äôd ask Mr. Poor how many more of these degenerate, no-talent Young Earthers the MSM needs to sully themselves with before Newsbusters is satisfied?

It‚Äôs also worth noting that CNN could have seen this sort of nonsense coming if they‚Äôd bothered to look; Red State has long laid claim to the title of Internet Tough Guy, USA, and rarely does a day pass on that misguided manifestation of Web 2.0 that an administrator does not force some mere user to apologize for having accidentally implied something or ban some wayward troll with a sprinkle of bad action movie dialog. The culture being as it is, Erickson is almost certainly unembarrassed by his goofy outburst, and one has to wonder at such a person, or rather not wonder at all. When I was quite a bit younger and in some emotional turmoil over the death of a female to whom I‚Äôd been close, I myself challenged someone on the other end of an internet debate to an actual fight when I stupidly considered the honor of some of my military veteran relatives to have been sullied through the proceedings, and though I soon apologized for having acted in such a ridiculous manner, I‚Äôm still occasionally shaken by embarrassment when the incident comes to mind. That there exists a class of people who take routine and flamboyant pains to illustrate their badassness to the world, offering fistfights to people half a continent away and conjuring up improbable scenarios whereby they would win the day through manliness and shotguns, is of course very amusing. When some of these people are given positions of extraordinary influence within the nation‚Äôs most prominent news outlets, it‚Äôs alarming, though still amusing. When it happens, though, it‚Äôs time for religious conservatives to calm down a bit and acknowledge that the deficits of the mainstream media are actually working in their favor.

For those people who do not suffer from the handicap of being Jeff Poor, I would once against propose that you spend a few minutes in considering my proposal by which we may perhaps have a wholesome effect on such things as CNN.

You could grow some of your own food and buy the rest at thrift stores. Make your own clothes and buy the rest at garage sales.  Buy everything in used but good condition, and reuse it again if possible for the second kid.  Walk places or use public transportation to avoid those costs.  Send them to public school or maybe home-school them if you want.  Have your kid play in the park instead of buying him a Playstation.  They can get a job and pay for their own car if they want it.

t3_bmen5,AskReddit,1,0, train ,"I can give you a few reasons off the top of my head;

1. **Opportunity cost**. If you have the smarts and credentials to go to a top 30 program in econ, you should have the ability to enter a professional master's program -- an MBA, for instance -- and/or enter the private sector and make much, much more money than you would spending 5-8 years in a PhD program making assistantship or fellowship money. Something to consider is that, for most people, the investments you make in your youth are the most fruitful when you retire. Spending 5-8 years soon after undergrad in school really cuts into your lifetime earnings.

2. **The state of academia** is such that the jobs that PhD programs train you to fill -- tenured professorships at US research universities -- are absolutely glutted with applicants. It's routine now for associate professor positions to receive upwards of 500 applicants each in the humanities. Though the situation is slightly better in the social sciences, you really need to attend a top 30 university (in econ -- for most disciplines, it's probably around top 15) to have a realistic chance at working at a research university, maybe top 50 to work at a community college or private liberal arts college. 

Without an enduring, unreasonable devotion to your discipline and narrow field of interest, you'd probably be just as happy, fulfilled, and well-compensated (if not more... yeah probably more) if you did something else. It's not so much that you won't be able to find a job with a PhD, but rather that you won't be able to find a job that rewards you fairly for the work you put in for the degree.

But then again, if you are loony enough (and I mean this very affectionately) about modern economic research, and if you don't need to take out any loans to go to grad school... I can't really tell you not to go for it. I did :)

PS. One great resource for economics grad applicants especially is the Econ PhD forum at http://www.urch.com/forums/forum.php. Definitely check that out for more info and advice.

However, easter is a national holiday and it is traditionally spent at a mountain cabin, eating oranges and chocolate and reading murder mysteries.
The murder mysteries-part is unique to Norway. It started in 1923 when two norwegian authors wrote a murder mystery to earn some quick cash. It was published during the easter break and on the day it was published the publisher ran an ad in the papers with the books title. 
The title of the book was can be translated to something like ""The train to Bergen was robbed last night."" The ad was so successful that many people believed that the train had been robbed.

5. Culturally and historically rich, great diversity of beautiful landscapes, the Alps, the North Sea, castles, historic town centers etc.

This is today's economy:

* 42.8% of the unemployed - more than 6.7 million workers - have been unemployed 27 weeks or longer.

* 425,000 of those workers joined the ""27 weeks and over"" club last month alone.  The average duration of unemployment rose by 2.8 weeks last month alone; may I remind everyone that a month only has 4.5 weeks in it?

* Hourly earnings fell last month.  How does consumer spending recover if average hourly earnings are going down?

* The government spent $333 billion more than it taxed in March.  That's 28% of GDP - or nearly one in THREE dollars spent in the economy.

All G7 countries, except Canada and Germany, will have debt-to-GDP ratios close to or exceeding 100 percent by 2014, Lipsky said in a speech  today at the China Development Forum in Beijing. Already this year, the average ratio in advanced economies is expected to reach the levels seen in 1950, after World War II, he said. The government debt ratio in some emerging market nations had also reached a ‚Äúworrisome level.‚Äù

#  There is no way we'll get into hyperinflation BEFORE debt deflation has run its course.

# There is no way the Federal Reserve (or ECB, Bank of Japan) can print enough money, electronically or physically, to fabricate hyperinflation, as long as the debt deflation train hasn't finished running over our economic systems.

# After that train is done, it's anybody's guess; the damage done will be so severe there may not be a Fed left to inflate even a party balloon.

I have a pekingese that costs between $30 - $40 per month to groom.  I knew that when we got him, but some people are surprised at the cost. Take your dog to obedience classes to train him properly.

It's not only fair to the people whose job relies on users paying for the software, but also to your peers, who have to compete against you with rates that have the cost of software factored in.

t3_bmmvv,AskReddit,19,0, train ,"Okay, stuff. I'm ADD, I didn't go through the school system, but I hope I can offer some insights. 

Numero uno: don't think of it as attention that's lacking, think of it as filters. We lack the ability to sort or filter perceptions or thoughts by relevance. Every single email in our mental inbox is labelled urgent. And unlike neurotypicals, we don't have your mental whiteboard of short-medium-term memory where you can store, correlate and recall useful/relevant stuff, move it around and pick out the patterns. All we have is post-it-notes on the floor - with a soft rain of incoming notes (all marked urgent) that we just can't shut off. 

If you want to experience it firsthand, get get a headmounted wireless webcam, and set up a conference call to a couple of dozen children from ages 3 to 15, so they can regale you with their questions and comments on your entire life, 24/7. This doesn't cover the chatter regarding your internal thoughts - but it's a start. 

The only respite we get is if we shut *everything* off, and slip into hyperfocus - just as you might grit your teeth, bear down and finally block out the conference call and tunnel-vision on what you're doing. Doing so, however, means we're *completely* oblivious. I've sat on a deserted country train station platform reading a book, while a bloody great train pulled in inches from my nose - and never noticed a thing until someone tapped me on the shoulder. 

As a result of all this, we are very, *very* good at picking out patterns and tangential connections - we're constantly drowning in associations and tangents, so *everything* is effectively completely out of left field for us. We have, if you like the 'spark' of genius that makes the inspired leap - only trouble is, we lose sight of it almost instantly when hey look a doorknob. 

This is our world, basically. Things that remain still... fade from our mental view, because they simply get buried under trivia. We start things but cannot finish them - we can see the whole edifice in our minds, and while the work is fresh, while we turn over new ground,  it burns in our vision... but the moment pure creativity runs out and the spadework begins, the potential for distraction rises exponentially. 

If you can understand this process, you stand a better chance of devising coping strategies. 

One thing to remember: concentration is a sharply limited resource. Trying to focus on just one mentally unrewarding thing is like holding a brick in an outstretched hand. It can be done, but it's fatiguing, and has diminishing returns. So learning to ration and shepherd it is key. Dig in for a few minutes - when it starts to slip, switch to another task (or source of input, if need be) to recover for a short, fixed time, then switch back. Sets and reps, just like exercise. 

His task and time management will *never* be worth shit, so don't make him rely on them. Don't suggest a notebook - it's not remembering *that* X that's the problem, it's remembering *to* X, in a timely fashion. You don't pull out a notebook on your way to the fridge just in case there's a note in there to remind you to do something on the way - nothing prompts you to check, and that's exactly our problem. We only think things that we're directly reminded of. I rely almost exclusively on habit, and that'll probably be his best chance. We have fantastic autopilots - we walk around on them all the time. I remember to do the shopping on my way home from work because I *always* do the shopping on my way home from work. Of course, I've often had to go back three times because I've autopiloted my way to the checkout and halfway home while thinking about the things I still had to buy... but that's an occupational hazard.

Disrupt our routine, and we'll be discombobulated all day. I've been distracted from taking my lunch to work by my wife reminding me to take my lunch to work - and there's a certain domino effect there. If I go buy lunch on the way because I was distracted from taking it with me, I'll likely forget to buy my bus ticket. If I'm late because I had to go back to the newsagent to buy my bus ticket, then I'll likely forget.... rinse and repeat.

Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood. then there was a wonderful shot of a child‚Äôs arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never‚Äî‚Äî"

If someone tries to beam a nuke onto your teleporter pad, you just refuse to accept delivery, leave it particalized or beam it back to the source. Of course, this only works if you need to have a teleportation station at each end of the journey.

Some purebreeds that are better for allergies are malteses, bichons, and schnauzers, but considering the dogs you like it sounds like you won't like those things. In that case, I'd suggest looking for a poodle mix. You can't just assume that every poodle mix will be okay - because they are a mix, not a standard breed, there is no standard type for a goldendoodle or similar. Depending on the genetic dice throw, one dog from a little may be find for your son, and another dog will be terrible. You'll need to have your son interact with the dog and see how he feels. Depending on how old he is, this may not be possible.

There are a lot of lifestyle changes you can make to help your son as well. If you have hardwood floors, mop them regularly. If you have carpet, get a good vacuum cleaner and vacuum often. Don't allow the dog in your son's room. Train it to stay off of furniture. Your son should also avoid touching the dog's water dish and any toys.

I firmly believe that one pistol is difficult enough to master and that injecting another simply distracts you from knowing your primary weapon.

If you want something indestructible and reliable you should probably look at a Glock. This has the added benefit of being pretty ubiquitous, with plenty of replacement parts that require little or no fitting and plenty of gunsmiths capable of working on them; and plenty of popular support for DIY work. The Glock's ability to take punishment is well documented, and its available in all shapes/sizes/chamberings.

If you are concerned about ammunition prices you should load your own, this can present some difficulty if you opt for a glock, though really only if you choose lead bullets and use very hot loads for practice.

t3_bmqhz,Seattle,16,0, bus ,"I moved from Atlanta to Seattle in July of 09 after finishing my bachelor's. My sister lives here in Seattle, and I mainly just wanted a change of pace.

I'll answer the questions that I can:

**Rent** - I live in the central district in a large house with 6 other people. I pay $550 a month in rent and utilities, on average.

**Dog friendly** - Yes. Very. Coffee houses and businesses here often have cans of dog biscuits at the registers, and your dog can ride the bus if you pay for it.

**Economy** - I moved here with about 3 years of ad agency/studio experience and it took me about 2.5 months to find a minimum wage internship position at a local ad agency. Things have recently gotten better, but that was a dark and unpleasant 5 months. Minimum wage is hard to live on in this town.

Best and worst? Hrm...

**Good**:

* There are a ton of parks here. A ton! So many to explore that I haven't had the time to see them all. Also, everything is very close and there's not as much sprawl as you might find in Texas.

* I once had a tank of gas last me 3 months because I bike everywhere. There are many bike lanes and it's a good city for it.

* There's always something to do.

* Attitudes are generally very accepting and liberal.

* People here are very green, if you're into that kind of thing. For me this was kind of a neutral point but an interesting culture change.

**Bad**:

* Parking. One of the biggest shockers is how hard parking is to find here. If you want to go anywhere in your car, be prepared to pay for it.

* I hope you can live without the sun, because it goes away from late October to about mid April. Frankly, I'm having trouble dealing with it. There are occasional moments and days of sunshine, but not as many as the latitude that we're from.

* People here tend to be very cold. The phrase ""the Seattle Freeze"" gets thrown around a lot. [This article explains it pretty well.](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/pacificnw/2005/0213/cover.html) Essentially, it will be hard to meet people when you move here. Well, you'll *meet* them, but it's hard to make friends with natives. I have lived in Seattle almost a year now, and out of the 30 or so people I consider my friends, only 2 grew up in the area. The rest moved in from somewhere else.

Honestly? I don't like it here too much. It's not a bad place to live, and I'm definitely glad that I experienced life here, but I'll probably be leaving sometime in August or September. Your mileage may vary."

That's mostly confirmation bias working its illusions.

If you look at the mass of current new jobs they don't really require a 4 year degree.  They require a base competency, presumably conferred by a HS diploma and a couple years of specialized training.  Dental hygienists and physical therapists really don't require Shakespeare or advanced calculus - though I might pay extra for someone to quote the Bard while cleaning my teeth.

The truth is that for most people 80% of college what they should have been learning in high school with, maybe, 20% more depth.  And most people emerge from those four years no more prepared for a profession than when they went in.

Universities having been trying to have it both ways for too long.  Either they can provide a broad liberal arts background or they can train people in specific professions.  They can't do both and it time to stop pretending they can and do either particularly well.

&gt; Second, you say that we need to sustain the bottom wrungs-- do you think we're doing that well right now?

Aside from health care, I think it's pretty easy to survive in the United States. In the example of the gas station clerk making $18,000 a year ... in many parts of the country they would qualify for a whole slew of public programs and assistance. Subsidized housing, subsidized food, subsidized education, subsidized transportation, etc. I just checked two counties where I have lived in the past: one relatively cheap, one slightly more expensive. Both would qualify the gas station clerk for section 8 housing.

&gt; I suppose you might say, ""well work even smarter.""

I agree that at some point people can't work smarter and move up. Some 50 year old guy that has bounced from menial janitor job to menial janitor job isn't very likely to return to trade school or college. But that's where the sustainable part comes in. You sustain the existing labor force until they pass on, and the new labor force moves in. The superseding of the existing labor force by the next generation labor force is nothing new. One year out of school, I was already more productive than a majority of the old engineers at my company. And as I age, the new engineers coming into the company will be more productive than me. So you economically reward them in their early productive years, and encourage saving for later less productive years. And anyone that fails in that process can be caught by the sustainable system. I think where much of the disagreement comes into play is in the definition of sustain. Spending $2 million of public funds for an 80 year old janitor to get a heart transplant that might extend his life for another year is not in my definition of ""sustain"". We have limited resources, and the cold hard truth of it is that we have to decide where to allot those resources."

The behaviour of those crews is despicable. Their comments to fire control that the people in the vehicle were there to gather weapons were false and they thus obtained permission to fire inappropriately.

Faster

No .svn directories everywhere

Allows for dozens of microcommits a day to their local machine, allowing much better version tracking, then but pushes up to the main server.

Allows for local branches for the developer that don't screw with the main development server (and 100x better branch merging behavior)

Allows for ""power programmers"" to use git-svn and allows for ""average joes"" to use the svn that took them forever to train them on.

Nothing about those shapes looked like AK's.  The cameramen had something shoulder slung and the next guys they identified as having weapons did not look like AK's either, too long and skinny.  Now I would think they would be better at identifying weapon types based on size/appearance/profiles but then again I'm not an Apache pilot.

2.  I agree with this, assuming they fully believed him to be a threat, I would just go back to my first point to say they shouldn't have identified them as such a high threat.

3.  I didn't see them either, I don't think they would have or should have been expected to.  Doesn't mean firing at the van was permissible, but I agree they shouldn't be faulted for not identifying the children in the window.

4.  Agreed.

5.  Agreed.  The camera that was mistaken for an RPG is questionable.  I feel that I could tell it was a camera lens and not the business end of an RPG but I knew ahead of time that they were photographers.  Also, perching up on the side of a building like that is a position an actual RPG armed soldier may take.

6.  Agreed, we don't know enough about that.  It really could have been in their best interest if time was a factor (bleeding out, etc.).

7.  Agreed.

8.  Well that's sort of procedure, and they did help the kids get out but they do more than show up to help injured combatants.  Where was this help from the pilots when they shot the men picking up the wounded?  They come to clean it up, confiscate weapons, and to cover shit up if need be.

9.  Again, I agree, it's really easy to look at film and not understand the context of the situation or what the pilots have been through.

t3_bmfs1,TwoXChromosomes,3,0, bus ,"Three years ago, I hurt my hand while riding the bus (I was standing and somewhat unbalanced, the bus took a sharp turn, boom). Shortly thereafter, I began to experience numbness and pain in my thumb and wrist. The pain ranged from annoying to crippling, and as this was my dominant hand, I couldn't very well stop using it.

I went to the doctor, who after a cursory examination declared I had carpal tunnel syndrome. No one bothered to x-ray my hand. She did send me to a nerve specialist, who found that there was no nerve damage. Still, the carpal tunnel diagnosis stood, and my doctor advised me to buy a wrist brace, avoid repetitive motion/using the hand, and to take a lot of ibuprofen.

The ibuprofen helped with the pain, but I saw no real improvement. During my annual visits, my doctor offered no new suggestions and told me to just continue what I was doing. I foolishly just figured I had a stubborn case or something (especially since I was unable to avoid using my hand).

After two years, I got it in my head to see an orthopedist. In less than an hour he had x-rayed my hand and successfully diagnosed me with a dislocated thumb. The only way to fix it is through surgery that will cause me to be unable to use my hand for well over a month, and will likely permanently impair the use of my thumb. The reason it's been another year since this diagnosis is that there's no ""good time"" for me to have this surgery--I will miss or be impaired in school or work for too long. If I had known about it sooner, I may not have needed the surgery at all."

And yes they live in a warzone where there have been civilian casualties as well as MANY instances of insurgents purposefully getting near civilians in an attempt to stop military units from firing on them.  

So wouldn't they understand the inherent danger of standing near someone who is crouching on a corner holding a long slender object that could easily be mistaken for an extremely dangerous infantry based weapon?

The whole situation is a clusterfuck no matter how you look at it but throwing highly strung soldiers in there who have to make fast decisions to the best of their judgement to prevent armed forces casualties is clearly not helping.

Another huge problem being we don't really HAVE any soldiers who are not high strung as the entirety of our armed forces are over extended anyway.

Enemy soldiers already are ""doing that"" as you put it.  Incase you haven't noticed insurgents aren't exactly wearing uniforms.

t3_bmjz7,Libertarian,0,0, bus ,"&gt; This is a very confused statement. Freedom means freedom FROM coercion, not the freedom TO coerce others. No freedom is violated if I defend myself from another's coercive actions, or if somebody else helps to defend me from it. Similarly, no freedoms are violated if I pursue recompense for any damages your aggression may have caused me. Libertarians believe in the non-aggression principle. In your example I am the aggressor and so your use of defensive force is legitimate.

I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree on who's confused. Is stalking and threatening you coercion? How so? To do what? But throwing someone in jail is explicitly coercion, as is collecting taxes to pay for the police officers and the jail. Yet we do not say, if we are rational and serious about things, that the latter are inappropriate and the former appropriate. To deduce what is and is not legal, or what should or should not be, requires more nuance than ascribing contorted definitions of coercion or non-coercion to the act.

&gt; With your examples of racial discrimination in the south, I suppose the laws that prohibited blacks from sitting at the front of the bus were just a coincidence? Again this very confused, because what you are calling the abolishment of segregation by the government was actually just a result of the government not enforcing segregation anymore. The Jim Crow laws were, after all, laws.

You're confusing two aspects of the Civil Rights movement. While it is true that the local laws discriminating against blacks were ended by the Federal government, what is also true is that the Federal government stepped in after the Civil Rights Act of 1965 and onwards to end informal discrimination and segregation, as on the part of the owners of private property who were forbidding blacks from entering their restaurants and places of business.

The military wants obedient, unhesitant gunners, which is perfect if all you're doing is fighting in ""total war"" scenarios.  If I'm sending people into Nazi Germany, I want them to be killing machines.

The problem is, we haven't been in anything close to a total war situation in Iraq since the first month we were there.  After Hussein's regime fell, our tasks were to put down insurrections, search for WMDs, and then rebuild the country into political stability.  Since April 9, 2003, we've basically been a peace-keeping force to one degree or another.

For a peace-keeping force, I definitely don't think unhesitant use of the trigger finger is the way to go.  Our goal is no longer to conquer Iraq, but to rebuild it.  Every innocent civilian we kill fosters deep resentment within a local population we're hoping to win over.

There is a way for people to become soldiers without throwing away their ethics and values. The men you hear in the video will at some point go home and have to live among us. There's a reason the Army has such a high rate of domestic violence and divorce.

I think it's really up to the individual soldiers to say no to the miltary, and not allow themselves to be de-humanized like that."

Here's a transcript of my email, feel free to use or modify it.  Please offer suggestions if you think it can be written more effectively:

""I just wanted to bring to your attention my disappointment that there has yet been no coverage of a video that was released today by whistleblowers (via the website wikileaks.org) showing the US military killing civilians and 2 Reuters journalists in an unprovoked attack.  Officially the story was that the reporters were killed as a result of crossfire in a conflict the military had with ""insurgents"".  The leaked video today shows a completely different story.

Here is the article on the incident from the New York Times in 2007:

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/world/middleeast/13iraq.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss

And here is the decrypted video of the attack as released by Wikileaks today (Apr 5, 2010).  They have registered this domain name specifically for this video, and have chosen the title to lessen the media's ability to spin this another way. 

http://collateralmurder.com/



Other news sites have already broken this story, but so far the North American news media has been silent.  So far Al Jazeera has reported the story and it is starting to break throughout Europe:

http://english.aljazeera.net/

http://www.dn.se/


It is a very disturbing video and the implications are very serious.  I hope that we still live in a world where this is considered bigger news than Tiger Woods playing in a golf tournament or the release of a new Apple device.  If we are to allow the official story to stand then we are complicit in allowing the military, of any country, to freely kill whoever they like and to lie to our faces about it.

I hope &lt;insert station name&gt; does the right thing and gives this story the time and focus it deserves.

Thank you,

However, chivalry does come from a time when women were treated like children or invalids, and that attitude still comes through in some of the gestures. I know it isn't intended, but I can't help it. 

For example: A man who offered me his seat on the train (although I am young, healthy, and had nothing in my arms) while an old man with a cane and a suitcase stood leaning on a post to stay upright. My response was to thank the man who offered me the seat, and then immediately offer it to the older man, who gratefully accepted.

t3_bmh71,canada,1,0, urban ,"Why do people keep suggesting alternate schools?  He's been accepted into three top schools already, I seriously doubt he wants to start reapplying to other places.  
  
Strictly academically UofT is likely your best bet, its a very prestigious school and its' science and engineering programs are always very highly ranked (generally second in the country behind University of Waterloo).  Canadians tend to give Torontonians alot of shit, but it's really a great place to live as a University student.  UofT is right downtown; you're close to everything and there's ALWAYS something going on.  For example, nowhere in the country gets the same calibre of live music as Toronto; if you're into live music there's something worth seeing almost every night of the week. Toronto also has excellent public transit so you don't need a car but a bike can come in handy in the summer.  
  
Montreal, realistically, is quite similar to Toronto.  McGill is a very urban campus so again, you're right downtown and close to all the action.  Montreal is known for being a bit more 'arty' than Toronto so if you're into theatre or the arts scene in general it might be worth considering.  Don't worry about the language barrier as there realistically isn't one, your classes will be in English and almost everyone who's local is bilingual, especially the youth.  I don't think McGill is very known for it's science programs however so that's something you might want to look at.  I will say that Montreal winters can be absolutely horrible; of the three places you're considering Montreal is by far the most likely to have completely frigid and unenjoyable winters.  
  
UBC I can't comment too much on.  I know that it differs from the other two in that the campus is much more self contained than either UofT or McGill.  UofT and McGill are basically right downtown in their respective cities whereas UBC is a bit insulated as an independent community which which has both it's up and downsides.  Vancouver does have the great outdoors lifestyle but bear in mind that much of it is outside of a typical student's budget and will likely require access to a car (ie., skiing is a ridiculously expensive hobby: equipment rental + lift tickets + gas for 3 hours driving each way + accommodation if you're staying overnight adds up pretty fast).

so i took a look around stalling for time trying to think of something to say. i opened my mouth and tried to say something but couldn't think of anything. then she said ""stay the fuck a way from me, i have a boyfriend!"". i just tossed my hands up in the 'why the fuck do i care manor [similar to the WTF! hand signal]. 

at this point i just kinda wanted to hide, cause this bitch was making a scene. so i turned my back to her and ignored her. she said quite loudly ""hey, i'm still fucking talking to you!"", i didn't bother moving. ""turn the fuck around!"" i still didn't move. ""i said, i'm not done with you"" as she grabbed my shoulder and turned me around (at this time he put a knee on the bus seat) as soon as i was turned around she slapped me ... she slapped me REALLY FUCKING HARD. 

my head was spinning a bit, it really hurt, and stung like hell. i started to have a metallic taste in my mouth everyone was looking by that point i'm sure. i have no idea how long i was dazed for, but the stopping of the bus snapped me out of it. I spit the blood that was in my mouth out on her shirt, and said to her calmly (i was still in disbelief, if i wasn't i sure i would have been telling) ""mother fucking bitches be crazy"". i then walked off the bus in a daze, than i realized that it wasn't my stop ... i didn't care, i didn't want to be on that bus any longer

Next, the camera does look like an rpg. at 4:06, he is crouched and peering around the corner(perhaps looking for the gunship?) with what looks like an rpg. If i didn't know that was a camera i would have guessed that it was an rpg. this is hardly what i would describe as ""Relaxed behavior""... how often do you crouch and peer around corners when you're ""relaxing""?

Why did they engage the van?

If any country attempts to build a 10 billion Euro solar plant in the ""middle of nowhere"" it is going to take 20 billion worth of Euros to keep people away from it long enough to get any energy out of it--especially if it is well known that the energy is being sold to Europe rather than used locally.

Here is where this whole plan will go horribly wrong: *It is left to the sovereignty of the producing countries ...*

&gt;the costs and risks are outweighed by the potential rewards

The costs and risks will be paid by the same people who always pay for the costs and risks--the poorest of the poor. Many of them will pay with their lives. A few will become richer but most of the poor will become poorer. Rewards, if any, will be split among the company officials, government officials and the security force bosses.

The whole idea is a wonderful plan and it has been in the works for a while, but so far, I do not see a single African country signing up to host the solar plants. Looking at the map, I would also say that there are a lot of African countries that are going to be unhappy about being excluded, even if they wouldn't participate anyhow.

&gt;they won't need fences or much security because it'll be largely inaccessible.

So, you think the parent company is going to drop these plants into place without building any transportation infrastructure? I think not. "

You also mentioned level *design* being good somewhere, when in fact it sounded (to me) as if you just meant, well, level *decoration* (graphics). If the gameplay indeed consists of (literally, since it's in a metro?) *rails*, it's probably a very uninspired layout design. If you mention stupid AI that ""just runs towards you"", it might actually be another layout design flaw, not giving them any room for maneuvers (or even any motivation for programmers to write code for such scenarios). Half-Life, for example, sent you from one ""arena"" to the next, in a linear order, but each allowing a myriad of ways of fighting. Think the room where you first encounter the female assassins, the blind tentacles or most encounters with squads of human grunts. Metro 2033, in comparison, seems to mostly consist of corridors and placing all enemies straight in front of you, not even giving enemies a *chance* to use any advanced AI, so it might be a layout/level design flaw as well as an AI one. There are many layers between ""linear"" and ""rail shooter"" and Metro 2033 seems to lean towards the latter more than most other FPSs I ever encountered (even more than the new CoDs). But that's just me trying to smear that line of thinking into the minds of future game journalists...

I don't share your cynicism. If the success of the project is tied to local prosperity, the local population will support it. From what I've read of the project, this is how it is being planned. They are not going to do a 'Shell in the Niger Delta' and steal the product while poisoning the locals.

&gt; A few will become richer but most of the poor will become poorer. 

Highly unlikely - you can't get poorer than having nothing. A supply of cheap energy will lift many out of poverty. Tens of thousands of PV panels will need thousands of workers to keep clean - and there will be many skilled / semi-skilled jobs that can be taken by locals.

&gt; ...I do not see a single African country signing up to host the solar plants.

Well, they just need provide assurances of security and they might get a slice of the pie. If the project takes off, some of the more unstable regions might want to change their ways and join the party.

It's possible - build them on the coast away from habitation and ship in materials and men.

Edit: BTW, a spreadsheet is your *bestest* friend when it comes to loans and how you can best pay them off.

This is a practice I *highly* recommend to everyone with whatever debts they have, whether student loan, car loan, home mortgage, or credit card -- nothing beats seeing **in detail** how the balances change and the interest adds up, etc. -- and to preferably do it *BEFORE* they sign up for the debt (IOW, don't let the banker or salesman figure out ""how much home/car"" you will probably be ""able to afford"" -- you figure out how much of your future income that YOU want to spend and then back-figure it to how much you find acceptable to borrow.)"

But in truth Im rather desensitized to being offended, it is more that I've just learned the hard way over the years not to waste time on people who only seem interested in hearing themselves speak and typically those people start their discussions with insults, so when things start with insults I just generally walk away.

&gt;(2) that the deity it describes is a megalomaniacal sadist which if it existed would be completely unworthy of worship, 

I'd be willing to debate that the deity described in the Bible is in fact worthy of worship.

&gt;(3) and that it is abhorrent to force children who cannot read and understand the tome for themselves to believe anything based on the book's tales.

This is a pointless attack. 

No reasoning person (myself included) will argue on behalf of brain washing children. 

I'm sure you agree that every reasonable parent already knows that they have a serious responsibility to train and educate their children to the best of their ability.

If a person is a religious person then ""to the best of their ability"" would include religious education, but that isn't to say it is brainwashing any more than it is brainwashing if an irreligious person ""to the best of their ability"" excludes religious education.

This is, that for about the first two weeks of life, the infants immune system has not yet fully engaged, so there is a brief window of opportunity for the infant to develop a complex culture of intestinal flora, that they will keep for the rest of their life.

Much of this flora, of some 300-1000 different kinds of microorganisms, they get from their mother, and any other contact source to their mouth.  Most of these are harmless and beneficial, and some are pathogenic, also useful, as they train the immune system to protect itself from them.

Importantly, not all flora systems are equal.  While many are essential to survival and good health, some microorganisms can be life savers in harsh environments.  If newborns could be given these, as well as their mother's culture, it could strongly contribute to their future survival.

But science has only scratched the surface in the study of intestinal flora around the world, and how it relates to its owners.

I had a congenital condition called PHPV which basically means that the mucous layer that protects the eye while it is developing doesn't go away after birth but causes scarring and other issues. The lens in my eye was removed shortly after birth as a result.

I've been aware of it as long as I can remember. 

I'm male and in my 20s. I don't drive but I live in a big city where public transportation is good. 

I'm not sure if you were asking me how my vision or my transportation issues effect my life. I'd say that I struggled a lot more with my vision when I was a kid and that it definitely made me feel awkward and nervous about certain things and it made it more difficult to form connections (even in college I had a lot of anxiety about bumping into people and finding people I knew to sit with in the cafeteria). I still struggle with social skills (for lack of a better word) but beyond that I think my everyday limitations right now are pretty minor and I've taken jobs in the last few years that require doing certain things that I would have been nervous about when I was younger.

I don't take any special precautions that I can think of.

I don't think it's obvious to people - my left eye is a little smaller than the right and the eyelid droops and some people notice this but I don't know if they connect it with blindness. People may notice that I'm clumsy and tend to bump into things but I usually don't like to talk too much about my vision.

The married person is called to the same thing as the monk, but in a different way.

t3_bmub8,ireland,8,0, train ,"Focusing only on D1 and D2 restricts you to a very central area, that isn't especially residential.  I wouldn't regard either as particularly unsafe, but of course there are good and bad spots, and the common perception would be that slightly more of these dodgy areas would be in D1.

I noticed you said you'll be working on Amiens Road, I'm not aware of an Amiens Road so maybe you mean Amiens Street.  If so, you're lucky, as it's a very central location with good transport links.  Your work will be near Connolly Station, where both DART (local train) and LUAS (tram) stop.  

The DART opens up a vareity of locations for potential housing, both within the city and right out into the leafy suburbs, to the north and south.  Staying very central you might consider the Grand Canal Dock area, from which work would be very walkable, but also only a short hop on the train.  Marginally further out, but feeling less city centre like, would be Sandymount and Ringsend, which comes with the bonus of sea views.  Sticking with the DART, but going further south, Booterstown and Blackrock is a nice spot on the train line, out of the central city area, but still lively enough with shops, cafes, pubs, bars and restaurants.  Further than that, and you're getting into longer journey times and more expensive territory.

The Red LUAS line also has a stop at Connolly, and it opens up the western areas of the city as possibilities.  The Smithfield area is fairly central, and let's say vibrant.  Some might suggest it's not the safest, but I've never felt that way, and I've female friends who've lived there without any particular worries.  Beyond that I'd only have very anecdotal advice on locales further along the red line.

The green LUAS line runs from the south of the city into the centre, and offers another reliable transport link.  It's terminus however, is about a ten minute walk through the centre of town from Amiens Street.  Sandyford and Dundrum are about 20 minutes out on the line, they're a nice enough area that've seen alot of new apartments built in recent years ... if it's an area you look into make sure you are near a tram stop.  

Both Rathmines and Ranelagh could offer good potential, they're both just on the southern periphery of the central city area, but are still lively and fairly safe, offering plenty of cafes, eateries, pubs, shops, delis and even a farmers markets at the weekend, if that's the sort of thing you like.  All that while being a reasonable walk from the centre of town, or well connected by bus or tram(Ranelagh).

Personally, these are some of the areas I'd consider looking at over the very central D2 area, as they tend to have a bit more of that neighbourhood feel.  

Hopefully that helps, if you have any other questions I'll try to answer them in the morning.

Also, I don't think he's necessarily advocating BRT over LRT in general: just to choose technology to fit the requirements and not for its own sake. e.g. Sometimes it makes more sense to go for light metro than for streetcars if you really want to improve mobility.

t3_bmwz3,AskReddit,3,0, bus ,"You're obviously worried about leaving her alone so far from home.  But if she's saying that she doesn't love you and isn't attracted to you, you need out of the relationship, period.  When that happens, having her around will do *terrible* things to your mental health.

So, take the high road.  Dump her and tell her she needs to get out.  Don't give her a few weeks to get things together -- give her a day to find her things and remove them from your house.  Salvage your own conscience by buying her a bus ticket home for the next day.  Don't ask her if she wants a bus ticket home, just get it for her.  If she doesn't want to go home, she can exchange it for something else.  Either way, the message is sent: get out.

Look, she's pissed off about your lack of being an alpha-male, aggressive d-bag.  So start being one now -- for your sake, not hers.  Take charge and get rid of her.  Not only is it good for your own sake (why let yourself be a victim of someone who obviously doesn't care about you?), but when she's on that long bus ride home, she'll have seen your aggressive side and will regret what she's losing out on."

t3_bmgnd,canada,2,0, station ,"A good friend of mine was tackled from behind by the cops, who did not identify themselves as such, because he was drunk and looked vulnerable. He thought he was being mugged and did the only thing he could think of, which was to bite the arm he saw in front of him. He was charged with assaulting an officer. 

Before he was booked he was made to sit in a cold underground parking garage on the floor/against the wall, with his asthma inhaler confiscated. When he started hyperventilating the officers responded ""why are you breathing like a retard?"" He spent the night in the drunk tank, apparently for *being assaulted by police*.

Other things they did: 

* homophobic slurs (he's not gay; nonetheless they joked about it while interrogating him, also about him having rabies); when he came back the next day to be fingerprinted he was greeted by one of those officers with the words ""how are you, faggot?"". He wasn't wearing a badge anywhere visible and nobody at the station would give out the guy's name or badge number for my friend to file a complaint.
* xenophobic/racial slurs (he's very pale white Caucasian, but a Slavic last name): ""Where were you born?"" ""My mom was born here, my dad was born in England."" ""Well we don't need your kind in Canada!""
* broke his iPod and his watch. 

He was sentenced to community service and doesn't have a criminal record (after a certain amount of time), but the psychological trauma of it was immense. Toronto's finest really put him through the worst half year of his life.

Another friend of mine was witness to an altercation at his frat house and was badgered and threatened with charges of obstruction/confiscation of his computers by the police. He was scared into talking to them without a lawyer present (he wasn't told he had the right to an attorney, he thought that that only applied once charges had been filed against him).

t3_bmiiz,reddit.com,1,0, station ,"A lot of doors in commercial settings will have a motion sensor on the secured side to allow you to exit (egress) by just shoving on the door instead of having to turn a knob, if it's a high traffic environment. Also, a lot of security companies just install them by default, because they either couldn't coordinate with the door subcontractor to get the right kind of handles installed (the kind you can turn from the inside to open the door without unlocking it) or the security system went in long after the doors went in. Also, fire code in many applications requires two methods of emergency egress on access-controlled doors in case of a fire (turn the knob + motion sensor or big paddle button on the wall, usually).

So, basically if you can trip the motion sensor on the opposite side of the door, it will just open for you.

It's a Iraqi town full of brown people with a brown people government and a brown people military and a brown people nation that was our ally the last time I read the paper bub. 

And good guys don't go out on military patrols in the capitals of friendly brown allies and fire hellfire missiles and 30mm cannons at armed and unarmed brown people who might have not liked the military patrols in their neighborhoods. Good guys sure as hell don't kill unarmed civilians trying to help a reuters reporter get to the hospital, or unarmed guys standing around on a sidewalk near their bodyguard. 

There's no weapons of mass destruction and no matter how many brown people the US military patrols kill, it doesn't give them any more justification for more violently killing brown people in a national capital of a country they sure as hell ain't at war with and sure as hell don't have a reason to BE at war with.

Shit man- I'm sitting over here in the U.S. and I saw that RPG. One guy had a RPG. Big fucking whoop. A brown guy has a RPG across the planet and I'm supposed to feel like we're supposed to spend billions just to stop him! Big fucking whoop. What a waste of fucking money. And I'm supposed to support the killing of the two guys with AK-47's, the other unarmed civilians standing around, and a sweet-mother-of-God a Reuters Journalist! What the fuck. Waste of money, waste of life. Billions to murder brown people who never did me any wrong in a city across the planet that never declared war on US- we declared war on THEM.

Violently killing more brown people just perpetuates the whole cycle of violence you see. Violence upon violence doesn't give us any better reason to be there since yesterday, it just shows the locals are pissed off. I sure as hell don't see no WMD's, Saddam Hussein, or International Base of Terrorism. I do see the military unnecessarily 'patrolling' a dusty city in the middle of the desert, a country that always treated us decently until we started fucking with them and raping their virgin daughters like Abeer Qassim Hamza Al-Janabi. Now we gotta think- do we feel lucky? 

If I was running 'operations' over there I would tell them, ""We're in a national capital that we weren't invited to.

""Dear family and friends,

I have filed a missing persons report for my son, Michael. Mike has been known to ""take off"" in the past, for parts unknown, but has always checked in by telephone or simply returned home within a few days. This time is different. He has not been seen or heard from since March 27. He may be in Los Angeles or Orlando - we have no idea. We only know that he has been living on the street, in his wheelchair, for the past three weeks.

In addition to his Cerebral Palsy, Mike now appears to be Schizophrenic. This has led him to believe that he is in ‚Äúthe industry,‚Äù (meaning the entertainment industry). Mike watches WWE and TNA wrestling shows religiously, and will try to attend events in the larger cities that are easily accessible by train.

I have included photos of Mike, and a time line for his known activity - and what we have done to track him down - from the day he left until now. I am hoping that everyone who receives this will share it with their friends and relatives across the country. Maybe someone will see him on the street, or perhaps you have a friend who works in a hospital in a large city, etc.

It is possible that he is in a hospital, but he will not give permission for staff to call us. We have not heard from the police in over a week, and are not confident that they are putting much effort into finding Mike. 

I would be very happy to learn that he has found a place to live, and is being taken care of physically. If you or someone you know has any resources that could help in any way, please share this with them. Thank you.

Mike‚Äôs Time Line - March, 2010

13th Went out ‚Äúfor the night‚Äù

14 Called home to say he would not be back that day, had things to do

17 On Twitter - was in a coffee shop in Los Angeles - Starbucks at Hollywood and McCadden - writing to people he sees on television, asking for help

18 On Twitter - in coffee shop, Coffee Bean, at Gayley and Weyburn, in LA. Said he had been cleaned up at a hospital. Last tweet from there said ‚Äúneed saving.‚Äù

23 I filed missing persons report in Chicago. Police were not inclined to do much about it, since Mike left under his own power. Called cousin, Sgt. Mike Smith. Shortly thereafter, received a call from Det. Paul Carboni, who was assigned to the case. 

24 Another coffee shop (LA?), tweeting to Olivia Munn (from ‚ÄúAttack of the Show‚Äù cable TV show). Was apparently asked to leave (probably due to the stench emanating from him).

25 Mike called home - said he was not coming back. Later, tweeted from the Huntington Beach library - ‚Äútweeps and twolks send help please!‚Äù

27 Tweeted from the Huntington Beach Main Street library - ‚Äúhospitals wouldn‚Äôt do the bathroom change....low on cash....please also send help with clean up, very dire situation....if i can manage to get out of california since nothing matched up the next stop is obviously florida.‚Äù Florida?? Perhaps to attend a wrestling event?? TNA Impact in Orlando??

His last tweet said, ‚Äúbut im really stuck badly right now. wish i knew where some folks are, very sad, chair not holding up well.‚Äù 

28 Rick &amp; Mary to Huntington Beach - stayed for 3 days. Contacted police dept. immediately upon arrival, they were not inclined to help since he left on his own and was mobile, but they took the report. Walked around HB and talked to bouncers at bars, left phone numbers with them.

29 Found a wheelchair repair shop owner who had seen Mike go by several days earlier and was able to describe him. Shop owner was formerly with Sheriff‚Äôs Dept. and made up a flyer on the spot, and faxed it to all wheelchair repair shops in the area. Visited HB Hospital; they had not seen him.

30 Visited HB police dept. again to see what was happening with Mike‚Äôs case. Was told by ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù at the desk that it would take at least 4 or 5 days for the case to find its way to a detective‚Äôs desk!! Called my cousin in Chicago (Sgt. Mike Smith) to tell him about it, and that we had not heard anything from the HB police. A while later, received a call from a Det. Ellis, with HB police, who had been assigned to the case. He, too, was not inclined to take it too seriously, since Mike left of his own accord.

30 Found librarian at Huntington Beach Main Street branch who had helped Mike on the 27th. Reported same to HB police. Left flyer at library. Left flyers with Coast Guard and a ministry that serves the homeless (located behind the library). Talked to homeless people on the street and at the beach. Visited shopkeepers in ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù HB, left flyers and phone numbers. Called hospitals in the area.

31 Returned to LA, went to studio where Attack of the Show is produced, talked to security, left photo and phone number. Visited coffee shops that Mike had previously mentioned - no one recognized his photo. Left photo and phone numbers at Union Station with various security people. We returned home next morning.

As of today, April 4, Mike has not been seen by anyone nor heard from via Twitter since March 27th. It is entirely possible that he is fine - but it is more likely that he is not fine, smells and looks like an outhouse on wheels, and needs psychiatric care. Worse possibilities are simply unthinkable right now.""

You probably won't get any real shit for being a Californian, but you will get shit for complaining it's cold when it's 40 degrees and drizzling rain. Save up your complaining for when it's below zero, which it will be for more than 2 months out of the year, and below freezing for 4-5 months. If you're used to 120 degree summers, then summers in Minnesota should be a cakewalk. You'll hear natives complaining as soon as it hits 90, and you'll have some summers where it never gets above 100. The humidity is a killer though. 

From what I've heard, the bus system in Minneapolis is pretty nice on the condition that you work downtown and live in Downtown, Uptown or The 'Burbs. There's a light rail line that services the southern Minneapolis suburbs to downtown Minneapolis, so keep that in mind when you're looking for a place to live. St. Paul only has buses and I assume they operate with the same modus operandi. If you have an awesome old car and want to keep it nice, you should probably either leave it in California or find a place with a garage and park it for the winter. Road salt is terrible for your car's exterior. If you have an old, crappy car, stop being so sentimental about it and get something more fuel efficient.

I don't know anything about meeting people. I wish I did, but I'm horribly introverted. I'm told that the hip, cool and fun place to live and meet people and hang out is in Uptown, but the parking sucks. 

Tornadoes are not uncommon, but you're more likely to be hurt or killed in a car accident than by a tornado as long as you follow proper safety protocol, which is mostly just don't get in your car and drive after the tornado. There's also thunderstorms, hailstorms, blizzards, freezing rain and ice storms to deal with. "

t3_bmwpw,badcompany2,6,0, urban ,"I don't think this is true. Sometimes it's best to take up a stationary position to provide cover fire or wait for a good time to ambush. There are plenty of places on ever map that the enemy is not likely to look, and waiting in them often increases your chances of not getting spotted while spotting an enemy. Staying in one secure spot is also a good way to act as a spawn point for your squad. You really have to play this one by ear. I find that I move around a lot on cramped, urban maps, but I hold position longer on maps with large open areas. I'm not sure why yet, but it seems to work very well. I think it might be because moving in open areas without a lot of cover greatly increases your chance of getting shot by a person you can't effectively shoot back at, while in close quarter urban combat there's always some cover to get behind if you're taking fire, and moving around is necessary to increase your knowledge of the battle. In those big areas, you can just look around, but indoors and around buildings, there's always something in the way."

t3_bmu2d,politics,2,0, station ,"First things first, don't use vague numbers like ""hundreds of thousands.""  Yes, the number is large (any number greater than 0 is too many, but that's besides the point), but without quoting exact figures, you make your argument vague, flawed, and bias.  So, according to Wikipedia which has several other sources, the number is around 100,000 violent civilian casualties.  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War

Secondly, you inflated how much the United States ""created"" an insurgency.  Yes, the US completely fucked shit up, but not most of the reasons you cited.  According to Peter Galbraith in his book ""Unintended Consequences"" (I'm citing so you have a way to refute my points if you so choose), the United States failed to provide many things, but it did not create an insurgency.  For example, the United States failed to provide security after the fall of Hussein, causing the subsequent riots, destruction of infrastructure, and loss of priceless Iraqi artifacts.  Furthermore, by preventing members of the Baath party from participating in the government, the United States ostracized the only source of bureaucrats and administrators, once again causing post-fall Iraq to fall into turmoil.  The United States did not, however, create an insurgency but rather created a power vacuum that was filled by existing insurgent movements.  From Saudi Arabia (allegedly), AQM, otherwise known as Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, rushed in to ""defend"" the rights of the Sunni majority.  From Iran, various militias rushed in to ""defend"" the Shi'ite Minority.  The insurgencies were largely imported.  I am not saying the United States didn't make enemies out of Iraqi civilians, but I am denying your claim that the United States turned Iraqi citizens into the large insurgency you see today.  

You see no moral justification for this war because you personally don't, and (here, i apologize for assuming) for listening to too many political pundits, probably from the left.  Can you prove that the United States wanted strategic oil reserves, or just establishing military presence in the ME?  The idea is laughable.  What does the US need Iraq for a military presence when they can station troops in Israel?  Why would they invade Iraq for oil when they could invade Saudi Arabia, a country with links to Osama bin Ladin (who is Saudi) and Al Qaeda, and has more oil?  

You want a moral justification?  Here.  Bush thinks democracies are great; he's a neoconservative, that's what they do.  As a neoconservative, he sees it as his duty to spread our democratic ""happiness"" to the world, so, he disarms a proven, inhumane dictator who on countless occasions has brutalized his own people (see: gassing the Kurds http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_poison_gas_attack) while creating a democracy, promoting what Bush sees as liberty all the while building a stalwart against Iran.  NOTE - WHILE THIS MOTIVE IS LARGELY SUPPORTED, THE EVIDENCE I INCORPORATE IS A CONJECTURE ON MY PART.  Personally, I disagree with neoconservative ambition, but that is besides the point. 

Finally, don't ever say no one cares about the Iraqi people.  You are a crass, ignorant fool to say such things.  Even worse, I can't tell if you care.  Just because you point out ""no one else cares"" doesn't mean you do, and by emphasizing revenge you infantilize an entire country.  People defend the soldiers because they know soldiers and can more easily relate to them.  This is a PROBLEM, but only because such dehumanization of the ubiquitous ""enemy"" furthers atrocities.   

Did you not read above, how the soldier dictates how he fights for civilians?  I call that caring.  Did the American heads of state withdraw their soldiers from Iraq?  They haven't?  Oh, I guess they care.  If they didn't, why would they stay?  They don't get enough oil for that to be justification, and current world opinion says Americans should get the hell out of there.  So why stay if there is no advantage and it makes people hate us?  I personally don't think it's an aversion to losing; the US left Saigon and survived; they could do the same to Baghdad if they had the inclination, but no, they didn't. 



Before people start crying that I don't understand because I'm not Iraqi (I'm not) or for some other equally valid reason, know this.  I think war is horrible and, as far as I can tell, so do most soldiers.  If there was some plausible way for the violence to end immediately, I'd say that.  A single drop of blood shed is too much, and death makes willing combatants.   No peace can be found in more war. 

Lyrebird, you have attacked soldiers, presumed lies and conspiracies, and have done so with the perfect 20/20 vision of hindsight.  You've made an impassioned case against continuing war in the name of profits and occupation.  On those points, I agree, but you have approached the entire topic with too narrow and vague a perspective.  If I had to guess, I'd assume you were either young, or a conspiracy theorist.  Either way, you get too much information from pundits and media according to the examples you used to further your argument.  This leads to you missing key facts and distorting others, all the while painting soldiers and American personnel as devils and Iraqis as angels.  Know this: no individual is perfect, both Iraqi and American act as humans do, for better or for worse.  Until you treat both sides of the conflict as smart yet flawed humans, you're part of a problem, not a solution.  "

As George Orwell put it

http://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/pacifism/english/e_patw

&gt; Pacifism. Pacifism is objectively pro-Fascist. This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, ‚Äòhe that is not with me is against me‚Äô. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security. Mr Savage remarks that ‚Äòaccording to this type of reasoning, a German or Japanese pacifist would be ‚Äúobjectively pro-British‚Äù.‚Äô But of course he would be! That is why pacifist activities are not permitted in those countries (in both of them the penalty is, or can be, beheading) while both the Germans and the Japanese do all they can to encourage the spread of pacifism in British and American territories. The Germans even run a spurious ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô station which serves out pacifist propaganda indistinguishable from that of the P.P.U. They would stimulate pacifism in Russia as well if they could, but in that case they have tougher babies to deal with. In so far as it takes effect at all, pacifist propaganda can only be effective against those countries where a certain amount of freedom of speech is still permitted; in other words it is helpful to totalitarianism."

I think that most people would be surprised at how diverse the TC really are... it isn't all a bunch of white people running around.  So in regards to being lynched for being an outsider: ugh no.

I don't think winters are *that* bad but my uncle from TX would disagree with me.  This year was pretty damn mild and we were under 0 only a handful of times.  The main thing is to stay out of the wind and it isn't too bad.  If you're downtown Minneapolis there is a skyway systems that connects pretty much everything so you don't even have to go outside!  There are a few apt that are on it as well (mine for instance) so if you work downtown you can walk to work without even bringing a coat :)  Also, while we get a lot more humid than 20%... it is nowhere even close to places like Houston (from personal experience).

Don't believe what you may read: our public transit is absolute horse shit.  The light rail goes to so few places it won't likely be of any use (it may be sig. better in the future but that's then this is now) and the buses... Oh god the buses.  They have the most terrible times... most of the lines run only a few times during the course of the day and if your schedule doesn't fit in... tough shit.  That said, they are almost always on time and are of high quality so if it does work out for you you won't be too disappointed.  I guess.

There are many places throughout the TC to meet people so I wouldn't be too worried.  The hipster area is uptown which isn't too bad.  I'm not a fan but if it's your thing...  Downtown (ironically north of uptown) has a lot of pretty good clubs, check out [sound in motion](http://simshows.com/) if techno's your thing.  Over by the U (University of Minnesota) there's a place called dinkytown with a lot of bars filled with college aged kids.  I don't go there so I can't really elaborate.  St. Paul has it's own batch of bars/clubs which are also a good time but I hardly go over there.  Generally St. Paul is a helluva lot cleaner and less flashy than Minneapolis.  Of course all the burbs/etc have their own deals.  Oh yeah and I can't forget ""eat street"" which is filled with the most wonderful/amazing restaurants...

Well it sounds to me like you're not really pirating games at all--just using pirated copies as demos to help you make a buying decision.  As I mentioned, the people that DRM is targeted at are not ones like you.  DRM is aimed squarely at people who might have bought the game, but pirate it instead *because it's preferable to paying*...the idea behind DRM is to make paying seem like the better option to as many of those people as possible.


(Although your equations leave it a little vague as to whether or not you still play the ""bad games"" that you choose not to buy...they also assume that you have the *right* to free demo of any game before you buy it, which of course you do not.)

&gt;What do you have to back up this statement? 

Common sense, and as if that wasn't enough, mountains of evidence in the form of nearly every torrent and rapidshare site that has ever existed.  I'm using the same stunningly obviously logic that motivates movie theatres, train stations and airlines to check your ticket to see that you paid rather than just taking your word for it.  It's same reasoning that tells you to put your money in a bank vault, and not in nice tidy pile on your front porch.

&gt;You just said the majority of the people will always steal something if they think they can get away with it.

t3_bmm9c,programming,3,0, train ,"Branching is trivially easy and headache free with dvcs.  It's an entirely local phenomena and can be used to handle the fact a person is working on more than one thing at a time (git stash is godly). There is very little of a ""Camp"" with non branching in the dvcs world because it is trivial, not confusing, and not a headache to merge. Being against branching in dvcs's is unfathomable, as every local repository is actually a branch.



The important amount time with svn commit is not the runtime (which can be non-trivial), but the fact *you are interacting with other people's code at submit time*. With dvcs, you are not. The ""save a copy of the code with a note about what I changed"" and the ""share my code with other"" steps are decoupled.

When you check into svn, both steps happen whether you'd prefer they do or not. This means everyone has to update before they can check in, and YOU end up fiddling with source control all day long (the merges and commits in svn are more heavy weight and fraught with work). Git has rapidly reduced the amount of fiddling I have to do, as I can make pushes only when needed, rather than having to commit (in svn) whenever it was prudent to make a backup..

With Git, you *only* have that phenomena of interacting with other code as often you want to have that phenomena (whenever your particular group has optimized the check in length for). Each person can check in a dozen times erstwhile to a local backup, keeping their code well backed up, and getting the benefits of dozens of small, minor check ins they want. They don't even have to care much about the comments, as they can do a command called ""rebase"" to smoosh them all together for the major push. 

With git-svn, you get the decoupling, but still stick with the svn backend you know and love. And your co-workers have not a clue you're using git-svn instead of *insert svn client here*.

So if you would check in 2x a day with svn, that means you end up pushing 1-3x a day, but you end up checking in about 20 times. Every minor change you end up making and want to back up, you can. It's practically ""saving the file"".


The reason I said his superstars could use git-svn while the less capable members of the team chose did not have to be brought up on it is that the more capable are able to self train on git pretty easily. I believe there are gains with the less capable too, but having to train them was an expense he'd already evaluated and found overly large.

There's the chopper jocks' callous attitudes towards killing; there's the willful destruction; there's the apparent lack of care in verifying targets.

I saw the Hellfire shots, and it sickened me that they didn't give a damn about the bystanders; what's your point?  That Apaches firing willy-nilly into an urban environment is even *worse* than I thought?  Thanks, but that assistance was unnecessary.

I honestly don't know if those guys were reporters; Reuters isn't saying and you can't see a press badge from that height.  I know what a slung rifle looks like, though, and I can tell a camera lens from an RPG, and that didn't take more than one full-speed viewing.  If these gunners couldn't make out the same details from their viewpoint then THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THOSE SHOTS.  I can't believe the Army doesn't drum that into Apache crews' heads the way they do tankers': there's no excuse for ""friendly fire"", so don't take a shot unless you know exactly what you're looking at.  These gunners either didn't have a clear-enough visual to distinguish, or did but lied about what they saw.  Take your pick.

I used to use optical equipment similar (although inferior) to this in a tank, but I wouldn't use it to determine whether 8 guys a mile away were insurgents, civvies, or reporters because I knew the limits of the equipment.  If these Apache crews couldn't tell visually what sort of arms they were looking at they shouldn't have fired, and they *certainly* shouldn't have inflated the observed weapon count repeatedly.

Seattle is a lot like the Los Angeles area, in that it's a group of smaller communities connected by highways, so while a scooter would be fine for getting around your neighborhood, you'll probably need to bus it if you ever want to go outside of your immediate area.

t3_bmsdc,psychology,-3,0, train ,"I strongly believe in this. The whole Jing &amp; Jang idea is all about body and mind in balance, something Asians already knew about thousands of years ago. A few years ago I slipped into a bout of depression and anxiety attacks, without any particular reason. For a few weeks I just sat at home feeling awful and feeling the attacks setting in about once per day. Couldn't sleep and couldn't eat, and was most certainly not productive.

I started out exercising because I used to do it a lot many years before, and I remembered it as a good way to empty my head of thoughts and problems, something that had, evidently, become important again with the anxiety attacks. Said and done, I went jogging a few miles, and when I came back I had the best few hours I had had in weeks. I felt relaxed and calm, with no worries or anxiety. My workout would soon become the highlight of my day, as it would be the only time in the day when everything would feel somewhat right. Soon I started working out almost every day for about half an hour to 45 minutes, and later 1,5-2h training 3 days a week, with 30 min workouts the other days. I would never have trained like this before, but now as training made me feel sane, I had all the incentive in the world. After a few months I had lost 20 pounds and was in overall great physical condition and my depression and anxiety was gone. Nowadays I don't train nearly as hard, I still feel good, and if I ever get the feeling of anxiety, I just train a little harder again to clear my thoughts.

This being said, my depression and anxiety, while very unpleasant, should not really be compared to severe clinical depression. I was never suicidal etc., and if you are, you should without a doubt seek the help of professionals. But I do believe that a lot of people in a similar situation like mine could use some exercise instead of going directly on meds."

t3_bmn6r,reddit.com,0,0, train ,"You don't seem to be very familiar with ethics.  

Let's start with Utliitarianism (ah, John Stuart Mill).  Now, utilitarianism proposes that the ""moral worth of an action is determined solely by the utility in providing happiness or pleasure as summed among all sentient beings."" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism).  Take the classic thought experiment.  You have an unstoppable train headed towards 5 people standing on a bridge.  You can, however, save the 5 people by hitting a switch.  In return, however, one person will be hit by a train.  According to Utilitarianism, the utility is in the 4 more people you save. 

See what I did there?  I just justified targeting civilians.  Let's go all historic for a moment.  With WW2 Japan, for example, Harry Truman measured the potential cost of life of American soldiers, Japanese soldiers, and Japanese civilians (for example, there are accounts of Japanese civilians running off cliffs with their children upon Americans arriving; they believed Americans were cannibals because their government told them so, but ah I digress).  Truman decided to drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki because he believed that this action would end the war.  According to Utilitarianism, he was justified.  

Not satisfied?  Ok, political science.  Machiavelli says the ends justify the means; if the end is ending war, then the means can be killing civilians.  

Let's try your World Trade Center example.  I assume Osama bin Ladin planned the attack in order to cause the Americans to leave.  Well, experience tells us that his actions in fact caused more deaths and suffering among the Muslim and American communities, so the utility of his ends does not justify his means.  What did he hope for, that the United States would pull out?  What utility did he seek; destabilization in order to further his own goals, or peace between Muslims and their neighbors?  Even when things are going his way, his actions can either be or not be justified.  


You know what?  Fuck the warnings, they even aren't necessary in any of these examples!  

I do not think human life can be so easily traded away; there is something to be said of the harm principle and individual rights, but in some cases the utility of the many overcomes the utility of the few, thus justifying civilian targets.  "

The problem is that this war should not have been started, not that soldiers dehumanize whoever they are fighting against.

If you want to blame anyone blame the politicians for starting the war, the media for stepping into lock step with the government instead of doing their job, and the people of the USA who went along with it out of fear and cowardice.

There is a nice coffee shop on the corner just accross the bridge to the centre. It's *sort of* for kids, but it is *amazing*. They have huge metal hoops for you to blow bubbles with, experiments with pully systems and stuff like that. I had the time of my life there.

Also, rent a bike. It is super easy to get around by bike, and a huge amount of people travel that way. 

If you are going to indulge in psychadelics like mushrooms, do them somewhere relaxed, chilled out, and safe...or don't venture too far away from your hotel, which can be your 'safe place' just in case you feel paniced or under pressure etc when you are tripping. Also, don't do drugs like that with people you don't know well and like, people you trust who you know you'll be comfortable around, but who you can also depend on to take you back to the hotel if they know you're not having a good time. Ask the shop keepers about what you are buying. Don't be embarassed. If you can't smoke strong weed, say so, they will recommend something that's right for you.

As for the red-light district, well tbh I stayed far far away from it because it would make me sad and uncomfortable to see all that stuff, I think. Other people have said that it is bizarre, interesting, and well worth being explored (Only if you are capable of keeping yourself to yourself, don't engage people in conversation, leer at the women etc)

The market in the Jewish Quarter on a Sunday is awesome. Sitting in Vondelpark in the sun is lovely (Apparently smoking spliffs in public is not cool, locals don't do it according to the Lonely Planet guide I skimmed before I went for the first time... and I've never seen anybody smoking in public now that I think of it).

The Canal Bus Tours are awesome, and a nice way to go all around the city and hear about the buildings etc. I didn't go to the Anne Frank House because I heard it was boring. I did go to the Rijksmuseum though and enjoyed it a lot. (Vondelpark is close to there).

One final piece of advice: If you are useless once stoned (as I frequently am) then organise to do your sightseeing during the day, then head to a coffee shop in the evening.

If you only act like an asshole in one respect (and that's all a single exercise like being condescending is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for bad karma down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.

It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.

Being condescending about an old meme basically only makes you look vain and to some extent, out-of-touch. What you really want to do is train your entire repertoire of assholery, all the major douchey comments (shock value, indignant, condescending, abusive) at the same time, over the course of a commenting session. And don't forget to post some stupid shit!

I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with trolling, being an asshole, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.

But do it right, okay?

My advice, find a good post, with nice people who will set up your douchey comments for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and unwittingly guide you in your quest to become a complete asshole. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).

And don't worry about being too nice or not being a complete asshole the first time you go to a comment thread. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will counter-troll you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.

Now sit on your ass and do it! :-)

But this *should* be about the entire U.S Involvement in Iraq, and on a greater level it should be about U.S Foreign policy and military training.

Events like this are an inevitable consequence of sending in U.S Army and Marines to police an urban environment where there are heavily armed resitance elements and a large civilian population. This is war, and events similar to the one in this video are always going to happen. There is no clean way to wage a war like this, so the question then is is it *worth* waging a war of agression in the hopes of then remodelling the target country (or rather, is it acutally possible to win hearts and minds).   In Iraq's case, it seems that the anti-Sadaam sentiment that has always been there has meant that the U.S *just about* been able to turn things around, but in the end it will have taken 10 years and more lives than it needed to.

Part of the problem is the principal of attempting regime change  (questionable in the best of circumstances) and in this case the atrocious execution and bad judgement of the Bush 'administration'. They sent about 1/3 as many troops as they needed to Iraq and appointed inexperienced republican party golden boys as administrators in the green zone. They failed to ensure the destruction of weapons, they had disturbingly liberal ROE in places (fermenting hatred) and they put every (surviving) member of the Iraqi military out of a job and onto the streets instead of holding the army together, paying them well and turning them into a force for good in Iraq. 

TL;DR
The video is a clusterfuck of circumstance, but such clusterfucks are inevitable whenever you put young troops in an urban environment where there is a large civilian population. The blame lies much closer to the top of the chain of command than the voice with the callsign Crazyhorse One-Eight."

Commissions are generally only granted for combat specialties; staff corps are folks who are already in pipeline or commissioned who become physically disqualified for combat, but can still serve (there are exceptions). 

You cannot negotiate pay - pay tables are set by Congress for enlisted and officer. There may be enlistment bonuses for certain specialties; I've never heard of a signing bonus for an officer. Officer pay will generally far outweigh any enlistment bonus. 

Both officers and enlisted have access to all the benefits of service, including the GI Bill. 

Most importantly: **STAY AWAY FROM RECRUITERS**

Recruiters are evaluated based on the number of people they get to enlist. They do *not* get credit for sending people to officer candidate school. Net result: a lot of people with college degrees get sent to boot camp if they talk to a recruiter.

A few notes - 

In general, in the Air Force if you're not a pilot, you're a second class citizen. You cannot fly unless you have 20/20 vision, so if you wear glasses, you probably want to go into a different service. 

Marine Corps officers all train as infantry first, then specialize. Every Marine fights. Depending on your goals in serving, this is good or bad. 

The Navy is the most diverse service - there are ship drivers, submarine drivers (you can't do this unless you have an engineering degree), pilots, special forces, etc. Pilots have the same requirement here - 20/20 vision, uncorrected. This is also the best way to see the world fairly quickly, since on deployment you will visit a lot of ports. However, you might also want to find out if you get seasick. 

Army officers drive tanks. Seriously - tanks. How cool is that? (Well, they don't actually drive them; armor officers ride in tanks, but I'll bet the tank driver would let you drive if you wanted to. Keep your head down)

In the state I'm living in, charters can only be funded to 2/3 per student of what neighborhood schools are allowed. The total amount they get to run a school is actually a lot less than that because they are allowed nothing for those things we fund outside the per student amount like capitol costs (to clean and maintain buildings) or transportation costs. 

I don't agree that charter schools are a way to game the system. In fact, I would consider that remark not only dismissive, but hyperbolic.  Parental behavior is not the given you seem to feel. It is affected by many factors and varies with the circumstances. Some teachers and some schools through their behavior, policies, and attitude, influence parental support or turn it off. 

Perhaps because charters pay teachers (here anyway) less, they must be granted more respect. A teacher who is trusted as a professional seems more likely to have a good attitude toward parents than one who is told every move to make and who is constantly being evaluated and judged. Currently I'm not seeing a lot of teachers treated as professionals except in a few of the charters. 

I'm not a big believer in the idea of sorting schools into bad and good. I'm more concerned with finding the best fit for the greatest number of kids. And I've seen many instances where the best thing possible for a kid is to be allowed access to a new environment, kind of a do-over. 

I love the public school system. Charters are public schools. I just can't see any major improvement unless all avenues are used to get there and that includes charters. "

Besides, I didn't actually accuse them of ""propaganda"" as you put it, I accused them of having a plan, which they always do. They do tend to tie their topics together quite frequently. 

Do you think that this video game subject line isn't going to spill over into some ignorant parents or teachers daily talking points, and bring up this little correlation. You said it yourself, it's basically a buzz word, since you have been in the military since 85 you know that this technology, and viewing system used in it is nothing new, so you know that the term ""video game killing"" really isn't accurate at all. So why support it? 

Either way it's sensationalistic bullshit that is going to cause more problems for a topic that isn't even related. Hell, it's not even that catchy. It's simply a headline made to cause exactly this... Disagreements. I don't think video game when I see that viewing screen I think ""cambat camera."" That's what I think, but hey, I am of the young age of 25, so what would I know about seeing a HUD like this. I am not agruing that it hasn't been called this in the military, I would be shocked, frankly if it wasn't; but it's not something a news station should be using, and the fact that they are using it like this definitely brings up some questions that I'd have for Fox ""News.""

I also have an education in Journalism, so things like this rarely are ""nothing"" especially when you're talking about broadcast journalism. There is a constant theme, and sometimes as far as a ""movement"" behind the messages that news broadcasting stations send... At least one that knows what they are doing. Fox clearly knows how to manipulate main stream media, and opinions. Call me ""paranoid,"" but that's fact. Fox picked that headline for a better reason than ""it looks like a video game.""

- the winters suck, to be sure, but you buy some warm clothes and you deal with it.
- public transit is pretty decent. Not as good as, say, NYC, but you can get around. Depends what part of the city you live in, though.
- I've heard the TC is very similar to Seattle in terms of meeting people. A lot of people here seem to have grown up around here and hang out with the same people they've known for the past 10 years. But then again, I'm no good at meeting people so what do I know.
- I've never seen a tornado in the past 3.5 years. We get a lot of snow. There are tornado warning sirens but I only hear them when they get tested.
- plenty of tech people out here.

I actually really like the Twin Cities. It's a nice size -- not overwhelmingly big but still big enough that there are great restaurants and bars, a thriving local music scene, and typical 'culture' stuff like an excellent orchestra, great live theater, and art museums.

t3_bmvb3,bicycling,4,0, bus ,"I haven't been to a London CM for about 4 years but the reasons I went in the first place are still, if not more so, valid.

I went because other road users were being ignorant to cyclists (as well as pedestrians) and people were dying because of it. [Just recently, 2 cyclists were killed by HGV's in successive days](http://www.movingtargetzine.com/article/two-london-cyclists-killed-in-two-days-by-lorries) but thankfully, the incidents resulting in cyclists deaths has dropped a lot over the last few years.

The plan was to ride as a massive peloton and make ourselves visible to the point where we could not be ignored, re-enforcing the viewpoint that ""we are road users as well!"".

On the few rides I went on, the amount of hostility from drivers was incredible and it was easy to see why people in the mass ended up coming to blows with them. In one instance, I saw a bus drive at a cyclist and crush his bike, getting out of the way just in time all because the bus driver lost patience with the mass not moving fast enough. In my mind, that is attempted murder but absolutely nothing was done about it by the Police cyclists that accompanied us.

I will concede that CM is more than likely populated mostly by hipster wankers who are out to fuck people off because that's exactly what they do best (and there are plenty of those cunts in London nowadays) but you could make parallel comparisons to the Tea Party movement: they had some genuine concerns and felt angry enough to get mobilised by have now been swamped by racist, ignorant cunts with their own shitty crap agenda and a complete lack of philosophy behind it.

Obviously they're not looking at olympic athletes or anything. Are they looking at Baby boomers? Women, men children? Or maybe they're looking at the average american. Okay, but to capture ""the average american"" in a sample, you would need a ridiculously huge sample size for it to mean anything. What is ""Many people"" anyway?

I thought this was kind of weird, and not ""creepy"" until I told someone years later. At the time, I thought this guy was an idiot.

I was a freshman in high school, and took the bus to my school. The bus stop was a few miles from home at a church, so in the morning, mom or dad would drop me off, and in the afternoon, mom would pick me up.

So mom's running late one day, and a old guy in a Chester the Molester panel van drives into the parking lot... No windows in the back, extended back, etc. This was a small church, and there's no one around but me - no other cars. The guy asks if I could give him directions, and wants to know where the Superconducting Supercollider was (south of Dallas/Fort Worth).

Well, I was too damned smart for my own good at the time, and knew exactly where it was. I had signed up for an internship there, and had been accepted... when Congress killed the project. Fucking bastards...
Anyway, I knew exactly where it was, and told him how to get there - take this road next to us to the highway, go east, then exit on Highway 287 and keep going for an hour - lots of signs, can't miss it. Well, he wanted me to show him on a map. Frak that - I'm reading my book, and comfy where I am, so I just keep repeating the directions, even naming the highways so he can see on the map.

He's not taking this well... and wants me to come closer. By this time, I think he's just an idiot, and my tolerance for him is pretty much done. I wasn't going to go near him, but then mom pulled up in her minivan, and I remember saying, ""Oh, there's mom!"", and getting up. He pretty much peeled off quick, and I went to get in and go home.

Mom asks me who that was, and I said, ""Some idiot who wanted to know where the Superconducting Supercollider is. He was asking for directions."" Mom said something like, ""From a child?!?!"" and gave me a very strange look... I really didn't think anything of it, and she never mentioned it again.

Thing is, at that time, I was the ""good"" student, straight A's, good attendance, the teachers loved me, etc... and I carried a 7"" folding knife in my bag.

If they took that into account, it's fine. If they didn't, the results may be off by a factor 3, which is kinda significant."

Am I the only one that noticed the gunner clearly tracking a woman and a child fleeing the scene?  He certainly made no attempt to fire on them...he didn't even report it to forward.  He let them flee because he clearly thought they were innocent.

No, seriously. To me this book does also not seem to have a big scientific approach. But if you consider that for me here the content of the wiki-link above is just plain general knowledge, you need also to give popular science it's respect, where it doesn't lie of course only.

It takes a lot of water and feed to create an equivalent caloric value of meat.  However, much of the real waste comes in from the way we currently distribute our meat.  

I will use my family's ranch as an example.  Our cattle graze on low yield land that cannot be used for grain or vegetable production.  The cattle feed on native, perennial grasses.  We do our best to increase the productivity of the land through irrigation.  We harvest the grass in the summer and save it to feed during the winter.  

In the fall, we sell most of our cattle to cattle buyers.  This is where the waste comes in.  These cows will now go to a feedlot and be fattened up with grains before butchering.  They are often shipped hundreds of miles in order to do this.  The beef from the cows before feed-lotting is delicious and lean.  Afterwards, not so much.

If beef and other meats were distributed locally, the waste and impact of the food supply would be reduced.  Feed-lotting was necessary in the past because cattle had to be fattened up to make long train and cattle drive trips.  I think grass fed beef can be distributed in a way that has environmentally friendly, and doesn't require us to use so much damn corn.  "

That isn't what I've observed.  I've seen more than a few people with rails shoot their optics loose at the range and haven't seen a single person have traditional rings and mounts come loose (simple dovetail mounts like used on .22s and air guns are a different story).  A little loctite probably would have prevented most of the rail problems, but practical results are what matter.  

A dedicated slug gun isn't necessarily cheap or low quality. A Tar-Hunt slug gun can put you back several grand.  

I've no problem with people using rails.  However, they aren't always the best mounting method.  I wouldn't use one for putting an optic on a slug gun.  I wouldn't use a rail for a skeet/bird gun either (for that I'd use something like a Burris Speed bead).  A rail will work for either, just not any better. There isn't much point to using a rail unless the gun already has one or the optic is designed for one. Furthermore the holes tapped for standard scope mounts can be used to mount a rail section.  The converse can't be said. This could matter down the line when selling or repurposing the gun.

Please help find Mike.  Here is the information we have, seeing as you are mentioned you obviously mean something to him and you could help reunite a man with his family.  Speak out to him and maybe he will come meet you at the studio or something.

From his mother.
""Dear family and friends,

I have filed a missing persons report for my son, Michael. Mike has been known to ""take off"" in the past, for parts unknown, but has always checked in by telephone or simply returned home within a few days. This time is different. He has not been seen or heard from since March 27. He may be in Los Angeles or Orlando - we have no idea. We only know that he has been living on the street, in his wheelchair, for the past three weeks.

In addition to his Cerebral Palsy, Mike now appears to be Schizophrenic. This has led him to believe that he is in ‚Äúthe industry,‚Äù (meaning the entertainment industry). Mike watches WWE and TNA wrestling shows religiously, and will try to attend events in the larger cities that are easily accessible by train.

I have included photos of Mike, and a time line for his known activity - and what we have done to track him down - from the day he left until now. I am hoping that everyone who receives this will share it with their friends and relatives across the country. Maybe someone will see him on the street, or perhaps you have a friend who works in a hospital in a large city, etc.

It is possible that he is in a hospital, but he will not give permission for staff to call us. We have not heard from the police in over a week, and are not confident that they are putting much effort into finding Mike.

I would be very happy to learn that he has found a place to live, and is being taken care of physically. If you or someone you know has any resources that could help in any way, please share this with them. Thank you.

Mike‚Äôs Time Line - March, 2010

13th Went out ‚Äúfor the night‚Äù

14 Called home to say he would not be back that day, had things to do

17 On Twitter - was in a coffee shop in Los Angeles - Starbucks at Hollywood and McCadden - writing to people he sees on television, asking for help

18 On Twitter - in coffee shop, Coffee Bean, at Gayley and Weyburn, in LA. Said he had been cleaned up at a hospital. Last tweet from there said ‚Äúneed saving.‚Äù

23 I filed missing persons report in Chicago. Police were not inclined to do much about it, since Mike left under his own power. Called cousin, Sgt. Mike Smith. Shortly thereafter, received a call from Det. Paul Carboni, who was assigned to the case.

24 Another coffee shop (LA?), tweeting to Olivia Munn (from ‚ÄúAttack of the Show‚Äù cable TV show). Was apparently asked to leave (probably due to the stench emanating from him).

25 Mike called home - said he was not coming back. Later, tweeted from the Huntington Beach library - ‚Äútweeps and twolks send help please!‚Äù

27 Tweeted from the Huntington Beach Main Street library - ‚Äúhospitals wouldn‚Äôt do the bathroom change....low on cash....please also send help with clean up, very dire situation....if i can manage to get out of california since nothing matched up the next stop is obviously florida.‚Äù Florida?? Perhaps to attend a wrestling event?? TNA Impact in Orlando??

His last tweet said, ‚Äúbut im really stuck badly right now. wish i knew where some folks are, very sad, chair not holding up well.‚Äù

28 Rick &amp; Mary to Huntington Beach - stayed for 3 days. Contacted police dept. immediately upon arrival, they were not inclined to help since he left on his own and was mobile, but they took the report. Walked around HB and talked to bouncers at bars, left phone numbers with them.

29 Found a wheelchair repair shop owner who had seen Mike go by several days earlier and was able to describe him. Shop owner was formerly with Sheriff‚Äôs Dept. and made up a flyer on the spot, and faxed it to all wheelchair repair shops in the area. Visited HB Hospital; they had not seen him.

30 Visited HB police dept. again to see what was happening with Mike‚Äôs case. Was told by ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù at the desk that it would take at least 4 or 5 days for the case to find its way to a detective‚Äôs desk!! Called my cousin in Chicago (Sgt. Mike Smith) to tell him about it, and that we had not heard anything from the HB police. A while later, received a call from a Det. Ellis, with HB police, who had been assigned to the case. He, too, was not inclined to take it too seriously, since Mike left of his own accord.

30 Found librarian at Huntington Beach Main Street branch who had helped Mike on the 27th. Reported same to HB police. Left flyer at library. Left flyers with Coast Guard and a ministry that serves the homeless (located behind the library). Talked to homeless people on the street and at the beach. Visited shopkeepers in ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù HB, left flyers and phone numbers. Called hospitals in the area.

31 Returned to LA, went to studio where Attack of the Show is produced, talked to security, left photo and phone number. Visited coffee shops that Mike had previously mentioned - no one recognized his photo. Left photo and phone numbers at Union Station with various security people. We returned home next morning.

As of today, April 4, Mike has not been seen by anyone nor heard from via Twitter since March 27th. It is entirely possible that he is fine - but it is more likely that he is not fine, smells and looks like an outhouse on wheels, and needs psychiatric care. Worse possibilities are simply unthinkable right now.""

Go sit on the outskirts of the city from any direction during rush hour and watch how many thousands of people commute into the city.  There is no commuter option other than driving.  Another consideration is that whatever public transportation is available does not suit the many thousands who work non-standard hours or who work long hours.

I use the fist-press method, folding over and adding flour as necessary, until there's a reasonably non-sticky ball.  Then I pick the dough up and roll it between my hands in a manly fashion.  Hands parallel, not too far out in front, pressing and rolling at the same time, like I'm mimicking a tiny choo choo train.  In a manly fashion.

I've also found that talking out loud (to yourself or whoever) in a thick Italian accent helps: ""I bake'a the bread!""  Repeat as necessary.

As the dough is rolled/pressed, not too hard but let it know who's boss, it turns inside out on itself and quickly becomes sticky again.  Have a little loose flour in the bottom of your pan. Dip it, flip it, dip it again, then pick it back up and choo choo train some more.  In a manly fashion.  I bake'a the bread.

After you've done this a few times, the dough will go from sticky to tacky.  Once it's tacky, you can quit or you can keep rolling.  Be careful not to get it too dry, though."

Bletchley Park, home of the national museum of computing, the enigma codebreakers, Alan Turing (Tube: Euston, then national rail to Bletchley, BP is right next to the station). It's about 30 miles north of london, so you'll get to see some of the English countryside. There's also Milton Keynes nearby if you want a gigantic shopping center (meh)

Other parts of london I really like are: Hyde park (just a big park), Cleopatra's needle (tube: embankment - just feels like you're right in the center of the city), the cafe at the top of the Tate Modern - great view across london (tube: southwark), river trips, covent garden market is fun. Everyone should visit Camden once or twice (esp at night if you like it a little wild)

&gt; Do I have to fear lynching because I am an outsider from California?

I'm a Californian and no one cares.  Be prepared to answer the question of why you moved here even though it's so cold.

&gt; How bad are the winters really? I've only been to Minnesota in the summer (I-90) and it wasn't bad, just a bit humid (I'm used to 120 degree weather here, although 20% humidity).

Depends on how you handle cold and how you handle snow.  I like the cold so that's not a big deal, however cold (except for the few extreme days a year) can easily be handled by bundling up more anyways.  The real deal is the snow, which makes transportation a huge problem.  I'm not just talking about snowing, but also the snow when it's left, it's not something most Californians are used to.

Summers are better in California.  It's hotter temperature-wise but the humidity here makes it feel worse.

&gt; How is public transit in the cities? I have an old car that gets terrible milage and would rather take transit than pay a fortune for gas (Please don't say sell it because that isn't going to happen, this car and I go way back).

Heavily depends on where you're going.  Transit can either be a dream or worthless.  For example, I can easily get downtown using the buses, which is great; but at my last job it would've been a three hour multi-transfer bus trip (one way), when it only took me 20 minutes to drive there.  Don't depend on giving up your car.

You could also be one of those guys who bikes everywhere.  It's possible in the cities.

&gt; Is it easy to meet people? I wouldn't know anyone there, and want to avoid a place that has a nickname for its anti-social population (The Seattle Freeze).

I wouldn't say this place is antisocial by any means, though I'm not really a ""go out and meet people"" sort of person anyways so it's hard to say.

&gt; Do you get insane weather often? (Tornados and stuff like that)

Not really.  A tornado fucked up a store a year ago, but that was the only extreme weather I've heard of since coming to Minneapolis three years ago.

&gt; And are there plenty of tech loving people out there?

I'll give you proof, its called common sense.  CNN has never cared about ""checking the sources"" of internet videos before airing them.  And even if they did it wouldn't take several hours.  Al Jazeera is a much more responsible news station and they got it up almost immediately.

CNN lives off ratings.  Even if we aren't a huge demo [as in reddit, digg, other sites] we are a large enough demo that if we show outrage, stations like CNN will react.  No TV station ever wants to have certain demographics pissed off at them.  Why do you think CNN is a ""centrist"" station?  It's designed to minimize outrage from both sides of the aisle.

t3_bmzb5,funny,44,0, bus ,"&gt; Last Friday, I was getting out of work. I was in a meeting so I was wearing a suit, which ended up being perfect.

&gt; I was waiting at a crosswalk, and this lady wasn't paying attention and walked into the street. She's about 45-50 I guess? The street was pretty empty in both directions except for a bus in the close lane that the lady didn't see. The bus was coming in pretty fast, and I don't know how she missed it, but to her credit there were some bus stops and parked cars and stuff that may have obstructed the view.

&gt; Anyways, just as the bus started honking and slamming breaks, I grabbed her and pulled her back. She would have probably made it anyway, but it made a pretty nice dramatic effect.

&gt; So this lady was really freaked out by the whole thing. She was sorta stuck in between thanking me, and catching her breath. So (and wtf did this come from I have no idea), I pulled out my PDA and said ""This is Commander Navarrette, I saved the subject. The time is 4:39 pm."" She had no idea what was happening and kept looking at me all dumb. So I said something to the effect of, ""Ma'am I need your signature to affirm that you were here and I stopped you from getting run over by the 4:39 bus.""

&gt; I didn't know what she thought about the situation, but I decided to press it a bit further. I opened my pda's drawing thing (ooo high tech) and asked her to sign it, which she did.

&gt; I thanked her then followed up with ""Your grandson is very important,"" which immediately I realized was really dumb because she didn't look like she was old enough to have grandchildren.

&gt; ""I don't have a grandson,"" is all she said. I freaked out for a second, thinking I just made a total ass of myself. But then I said ""You will,"" and gave her sorta a wink/smile.

&gt; The crosswalk light was green and I walked off. She stood there A few seconds later she yelled ""wait!"" but I was already across the street and pretended I didn't hear and kept walking.

&gt; I have no idea what she thought of the whole thing, but even the idea of her thinking I was from the future totally made my day. "

I think this has to do with the incident at the Swan. The Swan station kept the electromagnetic energy at bay by releasing the pressure in short bursts every 108 minutes. This prevented MIB from taking human form; he could only be smoke as long as the Swan existed. (I have a theory that all the dead people we have thought have been MIB is actually something else, be it MIB's mother, or the ghosts of people in the island underworld who are responsible for the whispers... more on this as the season progresses) MIB as Smokie cannot deal with water. This is why he never showed up at the beach camp. He needs the jungle for cover. However, since the Incident, the Swan is destroyed and the energy is out in the open on the island.

t3_bjdmd,reddit.com,1,0, station ,"35 mpg is kinda embarrassing for a midsize hybrid. I can see why they're not selling. I love my Jetta diesel. There's even a biodiesel station within a few miles from where I live. I can hypermile the thing north of 56 mpg, which bests my friend's goofy-looking hybrid. 

Still, while diesels are very efficient, and biodiesel shows a lot of promise (especially if they can start producing it from algae), they're still burning fossil fuels directly or indirectly. The best option for the environment is getting power from natural, renewable sources like the sun. While the initial construction of the solar cells is a bit environmentally unfriendly, that investment pays for itself in spades over the considerable lifespan of the cells. Imagine coming out into the garage in the morning, unplugging your car from the batteries charged by your solar cells the day before, and driving to work or wherever. Unless you work 50 miles away, which is rare, you're doing pretty darned well. 

What I'm thinking is that it makes the most sense to have an electric car for day to day use, stuff like work and running to the grocery store, and have one family car that runs on fossil fuels, maybe a TDI, for longer trips. 99% of the time, you're running around on sunshine power and for that 1% you're not using a whole heck of a lot of fuel.

I haven't thought too much about this, but I watch quali for every race and I only ever found single lap quali to be boring. I really like the knock-out format, I think it has made quali exciting, although I preferred it when there was the unanswered question of fuel loads (only to be figured out at the first pits on Sunday).

Now, I like overtaking. I like it a lot. But I can't help thinking that desperate overhauls to improve overtaking may divert our attention from other fascinating aspects of the sport. I like F1 because it requires intelligence and skill, and is not just the pursuit of 'action'. Sometimes the skill is not just about overtaking and fireworks. Sometimes its about Alonso managing to hold station despite having no clutch. Sometimes its about Force Indias punching above their weight (even though Hamilton couldn't find a way past). Sometimes its about coping with rain. And sometimes its about the fastest three drivers not overtaking each other, but simply driving fast and being oh-so-close to each other. Sometimes (it hurts to say this) it is about conserving tyres. What I am trying to say is that overtaking seems to be griped about so much that other interesting things about the formula are overlooked. 

However, I do think that the ban on refueling in F1 has not helped. We don't see the same sorts of tactical plans being hatched from Saturday afternoon through the race on Sunday. Instead we have drivers nursing tyres. 

On the topic of overtaking: In the BBC coverage, Brundle (or Allen?) mentioned the idea of a return for non-standardised KERS to encourage overtaking. Opinions?

t3_bi9cc,guns,1,0, rail ,"If the parts are quality and *installed properly*, there will never be a failure.  You seem to have drawn the conclusion that it is the design that is the problem, when it is most probably improper installation.

The point I am trying to make is that the gentleman who started this post purchased himself a multi-purpose shotgun, perhaps the most versatile on the market, which he intends to use for both slugs and shot.  For all practical purposes, a rail isn't going to mount a scope any better than regular scope rings, but that's hardly the point I was trying to make.  What it does offer is versatility that's impossible to get from regular scope mounts.  One can't quickly detach a scope that is mounted directly to the receiver if need be, and considering the firearm is a shotgun, he might prefer to shoot some days without optics.  If his shit breaks, he might want to take it off.  Why suggest a lesser alternative?

Personally, I think rails look cool and add an edge to the look of any gun.  Combine some ghost-ring sights with that rail and you're going to end up with a pretty kick-ass and versatile shotgun.

Also, scopes losing their zero from the rings slipping on the bases is far from common.  It is more common to see a scope slip inside the rings from lack of contact; a problem that regular scope mounts face as well."

The business of government is to manage the society that formed it.  Dictating what is socially acceptable is part of that.  You'll notice there are laws preventing you from pooping in bus stops or on sidewalks.  Social acceptability is a part of the purpose of law.  

There are times when social acceptability and actual law differ.  Then you have marches and protests and people trying to change said law.   

&gt;Hypothetical situation. Lets say my boss gets replaced with a black dude, and being the racist ass that I am (not in real life, but for the purposes of this example) I decide to quite because of it. Assuming I didn't violate the terms of my contract, should the new boss be able to demand that I continue working against my will? If not, then why should I be able to demand that he keep paying me if I get fired for some equally petty reason?  

To address this situation, you may quit for any reason you wish.  If your boss happens to be black and racist, he's allowed to quit too.  As an individual, you can make (almost) any decision which affects only yourself.  The new boss cannot demand that you work, because you can make personal choices for yourself.  But the new boss cannot fire you simply because he is racist (unless there is some At-Will employment going on, and even then, it's sketchy).  That is technically illegal.  

It still happens, but is illegal nonetheless.  It's simply easy to hide.

I'm currently in love with Sylvia Plath, having just written essay about her and her Electra complex. The women was incredible. WB Yeats is a winner, too, for me ('The Second Coming' is probably my favourite poem ever ever ever.)

I think an important part of *writing* poetry, not being a poet myself, is not getting caught up in all of the mystique and perceived snobbery that surrounds it. Trying not to get caught up in the tradition of it all would be very important. Try not to address and solve all of the issues in the Universe in a poem. It's never going to happen. Write about whatevers bugging you, or whatever you feel passionate about. Also: READ. You can't write without reading. The world of poetry can be daunting, but every single word, line and stanza is being absorbed by your brain and is, in some way, influencing and shaping your style.

As for the poetry and prose question, that's a tricky one and answers will vary from person to person. What is poetry? What is prose? To me, at least, poetry is an art and prose is (on some levels) a science. Poetry is capturing a feeling or a moment and condensing it down into 5/10/100 lines - suggesting and showing, rather than telling. Prose gives you the chance to develop character, allows the reader to align or distance themselves from characters, on a set path with only one conclusion - in my opinion, of course.

t3_bmxas,economy,2,0, urban ,"&gt;To go off topic from the premise of the article, this site has a bunch of maps from the 2004 election that are pretty interesting. Considering this  is probably what most people think of America, it shows how heavily distorted it can be. When you look at it as a scale instead of polar and include per capita statistics, you get this  and this  which paints a better picture (the type you allude to). I also found this  quite interesting.

Exactly (and those are the maps I had in mind, and even they are somewhat of a distortion -- especially [this one - county level winning party](http://makethemaccountable.com/misc/images/Election2004-3D.jpg) which merely repeats the mistake of [this one - state level winning party](http://makethemaccountable.com/misc/images/Election2004ByState.jpg) on a more detail basis -- they are distortions since ALL urban residents do NOT vote Democratic and ALL rural people do NOT vote Republican, the districts are ALL intermixed with some the percentages voting simply ""leaning"" to one party or another). 

The ""Blue"" states are actually ""purple"" -- with the prevalent cities and urban areas tending to lean more heavily toward Democrats; and the likewise the ""Red"" states are also ""purple"" with the rural areas tending to lean a bit more Republican -- yes there are some (rare) exception districts where the ""leaning"" is more pronounced (an 80/20 or 90/10 mix) but a lot of THAT has to do with the artificial ""gerrymandering"" of the political parties colluding in a tit-for-tat manner to CREATE such aberrations in order to secure various ""seats"" for their respective parties -- with the secondary goal of making certain that 3rd parties have nowhere to gain a foothold.)

To bring it back to the article's premise -- the thing is that if there is any ""civil unrest"" in the future it will almost certainly be of the Detroit/LA/New Orleans ""riot/looting"" nature than of anything like a ""civil war"". 

So, yes there is substantial political (and resource) difference between the rural areas and the city areas -- but an all-out ""war""?  Unlikely that the urban hordes would venture into the rural areas in order to ""seize"" the farms (what would clueless urban-ites do with a farm? besides, most of the big ""inventories"" of food and other resources are in the cities) -- and it's just as inconceivable that the rural people would en-mass rush into the distant cities (why would they want to?)

Much more likely (if resources become REALLY scarce and worst would come to worst and we ended up in some *dystopia-like* future) would be that the urban dwellers would first turn and attempt to riot and eventually prey and loot each other (shades of Detroit, LA, Paris, Greece, or even ancient Rome, etc.) -- and the rural types will ""guard and protect"" themselves from whatever small groups of urban-ites even attempt to relocate to the countryside, etc.  I guess you could call that ""civil war"" but I doubt it would last for long."

- All the Museums, especially the Imperial War Museum (that usually has some cool summer exhibitions), V&amp;A, Natural History Museum, the Tate Modern, and definitely some of the smaller ones I mentioned to Quellman below if any of them catch your interest.
- Definitely a walk, as I mentioned to Quellman in the reply below, it's most fun to get a book (search 'London walks' on Amazon or go to the Waterstone's I mentioned to Quellman once you're here) and do your own, but you can also join one of these: http://www.walks.com/ Plus, if you go on your own walk, you can take your time, stop at pubs and places to eat along the way, etc.
- The Tower of London is a big tourist attraction but is definitely worth it (take a guided tour), the British Library and the British Museum are good too. Some of the overpriced, overhyped, tourist trap attractions are Madame Tussauds and the London Dungeon, but maybe you'll want to see them anyway.
- Go to Borough Market for breakfast one morning (you walk around and eat delicious bits from various stalls), preferably on a weekday. In terms of other markets, a lot of tourists will go to Portobello Road Market on a Saturday, but more Londoners go to Broadway market: http://www.broadwaymarket.co.uk/
- See a play at Shakespeare's Globe.
- Seeing a film at the BFI or a play at the National Theatre is cool, but you can use the BFI Mediatheque for free and it's got loads of stuff. 
- A tour of Middle and Inner Temple and the Temple Church (http://www.visitthecity.co.uk/index.php/attractions/view/272/)
- Highgate Cemetery 
- The Enchanted Palace exhibition at Kensington Place will be on while you're here and looks pretty interesting: http://www.hrp.org.uk/KensingtonPalace/stories/palacehighlights/EnchantedPalace.aspx
- It will be summer, so try to be outdoors as much as you can be. Go and have a picnic on Hampstead Heath or, more centrally, around the Serpentine in Hyde Park, where you can go boating. This is what many Londoners do in summer. There is also opera in Holland Park (a smaller park, complete with bunny rabbits and peacocks and rose gardens) in June in the evenings. Visiting the Chelsea Physic Garden in summer is also really nice: http://www.chelseaphysicgarden.co.uk/
- Have a drink in one of the oldest pub in London, the Lamb, on Lambs Conduit Street in Bloomsbury.
- Walk around Brick Lane 
- Visit Postman's Park http://www.thejoyofshards.co.uk/london/tiles/ppark/index.shtml
- Taste of London - a big festival where lots of famous London restaurants have a food festival will be on in June: http://www.tastefestivals.com/london/
- Go on a behind the scenes tour at the BBC: http://www.bbc.co.uk/tours/

Finally, do not go to Aberdeen Angus Steakhouse or Garfunkel's restaurants. They are horrible places with terrible food, overpriced and tourist traps. 

The best advice generally is when you get here, buy the latest edition of 'Time Out', go through it, and pick out all the things you want to go to - there are always exhibitions, events, parties, etc happening in London and it changes every week. You'll find probably more things you want to do than you have time to do them in. A lot of Londoners depend on Time Out to know what is happening, so this your best bet. I hope you have a great time :)

Oh, and 1 more tip, if you're here for more than a week, buy an Oyster card from the tube station to get around, you can use it on any public transport and you just top it up with money at tube stations. It makes everything significantly cheaper - e.g. a bus trip is ¬£2 for a normal ticket, but 80p with an Oyster card, and they cap it at a daily travelcard rate.

People often treat normal rings for a picatinny rail like a quick-detach setup. They play [SOPMOD M4](http://imgur.com/MDOc9) without the proper base then the rings work loose from the rail.  I've seen it more personally than scopes slipping in rings.

I agree that it is a versatile type of mount.  That's why I said the following way back at the start of this.

&gt;Your best bet is to get a gunsmith to tap the receiver for scope rings. The threaded holes can then be used to mount a section of rail (or scope rings depending on the type of red dot optic you choose).

If he does ghost rings I'd encourage using a rail and quick detach mount for the red dot."
t3_bmz6z,politics,2,0, bus ,"In terms of the law as its written now, you are right and the kid may have a case.  That doesn't mean I agree with the law.  

Employment is a contract between two people (or groups of people) and both sides need to be treated equally by the law.  If I can terminate that contract because I am racist, then why should it be illegal when the boss terminates the contract for the exact same reason?

&gt;The business of government is to manage the society that formed it. Dictating what is socially acceptable is part of that. You'll notice there are laws preventing you from pooping in bus stops or on sidewalks. Social acceptability is a part of the purpose of law.

No, the law is not supposed to be about regulating morality or social acceptability.  The law is about protecting rights.  I cannot poop on the sidewalk because I don't own the sidewalk, but I can poop on my living room floor all I want.  If I owned the sidewalk, I could poop on that all I want too.

They law should not be telling me that I can't poop in my living room, or on the floor of a bar I own, because you think its not socially acceptable.  That's no different than the republicans wanting to outlaw gay marriage.  You just have different definitions of what socially acceptable is."

t3_bn3iy,environment,2,0, rail ,"So if I follow that wiki-link, it says a Boeing 747-400 consumes 2.6 liter/100 passenger-km. Which is at least twice as good as an average European car driven by a single person (never mind the average American car), and about the same as a car with 2 persons. The actual average is 1.57 in the USA, according to a statistic found later on that page. I guess those figures are using 100% utilization for the plane though. Which is exactly why I was asking.

By the way, since 1 liter of Jet A1 has an energy density of about 35 MJ (says Wikipedia), that's about 0.91 MJ/passenger-km for a fully loaded 747-400.

The very same page you linked to later shows a section on ""US Passenger transportation"" where it lists Rail (commuter) as consuming 1.964 MJ/passenger-km and Air as 2.138, which I don't exactly need mad math skills to tell that one isn't 5-10x bigger than the other (and even intercity trains still consume 1.737 MJ/passenger-km). By the way, that figure *does* take different types of planes and sub-100% utilization into account, which is why it arrives at the number of 2.138 MJ/passenger-km. And still that's even better than *cars* which use 2.3 MJ/passenger-km according to that exact same table.

So it appears that my skepticism in this case is rather well founded, wouldn't you agree?"

t3_bmg1l,scifi,1,0, train ,"Disgrace seems readable from the first few pages, but is also not written in the first person which makes it easier to read.   Snow Crash alternates between present and past tense, which can be really effective when done properly.  I'm not aware of these two other books, but I'm more used to reading sci fi and real classics.  I wouldn't call Snow Crash a classic, either.  

My argument is that calling me pretentious for not liking a poorly-written novel that is wholly done in present tense is bullshit.  My argument is not that you can't ever write a book in present tense, I was overstating my case earlier.  I just think it takes a really good writer to pull it off.  Of course there are exceptions to this (Rabbit Run - again), but if its not done correctly it is a train wreck.  I'm not saying you can't ever do it, but that it very easily ruins a book, especially if the writing is not good to begin with.  Try reading the Monkey Wrench Gang, which is a well-known and praised environmentalist novel, I'd love to hear what you think about how it is written.

Obviously a really talented writer can make a go of this, but this Paulo whatever guy, from what I read can't pull it off.  What is your opinion of the Windup Girl?  I couldn't read it.  To me, the tense made it really bad, but the writing was bad to begin with as well.  If the writing was better, the tense may have worked, but to me, it didn't.

Edit 2: The Indian Clerk according to reviews is written in third person present tense, but has inner monologues not in past tense."

t3_bmwvb,Android,1,0, bus ,"I almost completely agree for the reasons you mentioned, barring the philosophical, that the **services** should remain separate. However I think the **interface** for those services could be easily integrated into one app. They did it with Buzz [even though as far as I can tell Buzz is really just another service that competes with Orkut (the reasons for doing that are beyond me)]. While Buzz doesn't push across IMAP, it is available to use within the web interface for Gmail. 

As far as the historical philosophical issue behind separation of functionality into separate applications, it has also been part of that philosophy to enable the exporting and importing of output through interprocess communication in order to maximize both functionality and flexibility. While that works well on the command line, I would arguably say that it hasn't worked as seamlessly on the pointer based GUI, nor hardly at all, if at all, for the touch input GUI.

And, I think this is a huge mistake. The power of a modern smartphone isn't that it's a glorified PDA with snazzy graphics, but a mobile communication and information consumption device. As far as the end user is concerned it is inherently a data-centric device. And, while I'll put my personal opinions aside about Apple, that is where the Mac has always had an advantage over other desktop OSs in that it has always been a document-centric interface to tasks and services. While playing Bejewelled on the bus is kind of neat, the smartphone developer really should be concerned with exploring creative ways to collect, process, integrate, and export data in a near seamless fashion. I think this is where Slidescreen really starts to shine. While it still needs some polish and some customization options, it's a really good start.

As far as a merging of interfaces to Gmail and Gvoice: they both offer services of communication of data between two or more people. Personally, I don't care about the structure of the data, just that the data is transmitted to the intended party. In this sense it would be an advantage to have the task of communication be centralized to a single process regardless of the structure of the data. Any data that does not fit within the pre-defined structures should be seamlessly exported to the corresponding application for processing and transmission. 

So that's me feeling on the issue. Feel free to disagree."
