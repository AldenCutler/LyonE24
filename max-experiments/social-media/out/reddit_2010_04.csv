t3_btkgg,boston,1,0,"That gets really old really fast. I work in Cambridge and live in the suburbs and take the commuter rail and red line (about 50-60 minutes total) and trust me - it gets old, especially if I don't feel like reading my book. I'm looking to move to Cambridge, living only a few stops away on the red line would be amazingggg."
t3_btea1,reddit.com,1,0,"I don't remember the terms that were made when we bailed out Chrysler year ago. I don't know if we always took collateral, it seems so anti-Republican to have a Government interest in Private Companies. I do know the Gov. was forced to bail out ..What was that commuter rail line in the North east? After it was refurbished...they sold it back under Reagan I think."
t3_bunbs,boston,3,0,"Its a great area, if you are between 18 and 35.  I used to live a little ways up, closer to Porter Square.  You can easily walk to Harvard, or Porter, on a nice day.  There are 4 supermarkets close to you (that I can think of off the top of my head.  Star Market, Johnny's Market Basket, and another Star Market). R.F. O'Sullivan's has great burgers, too. The only thing I would suggest is that you go to the apartment, and listen for the commuter rail and redline, which go right by there.  They may be disruptive, or they may not be.

Also, do you own a car?  They area is pretty bike-friendly, so you don't need one, but if you have one, make sure you have off-street parking.  The biggest downside is that you will gain some weight from being so close to [Petsi's Pies](http://www.petsipies.com/)"
t3_bvjim,pics,1,0,"EVERYONE does this on the Boston commuter rail. It's ridiculous. Even at peak hours, when some people have to stand since there aren't enough seats to go around, you'll still find people stacking all their stuff into the adjacent seat, saying ""FUCK OFF I DON'T WANT YOU SITTING NEXT TO ME"" as strongly as possible without actually saying it.

Also, I never see anyone ask for a seat that's being occupied by a coat or briefcase; no, they'd rather stand for 45 minutes rather than ask for a seat that's obviously available. Maybe they think it's common courtesy to stand in silence. If so, I must be one rude (but comfortable) bastard."
