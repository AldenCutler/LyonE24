					<a href="iris_accessibility_map.html" target="_blank">Accessibility Map</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This interactive Folium map shows the accessibility of the Lyon
					public transit system. The map is divided into IRIS zones, which
					come from a
					<a target="_blank"
						href="https://data.grandlyon.com/portail/fr/jeux-de-donnees/contours-iris-grande-echelle-metropole-lyon/telechargements">database</a>
					managed by the French government, where each zone represents an area
					of approximately 2000 people. Each region is subsequently colored by
					the fraction of wheelchair-accessible transit stops within that
					region.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
						Overall, Lyon's system is very accessible, with only a single region
						(Richerland-Petites Soeurs) having a percentage of
						wheelchair-accessible stops below 50%. This region only covers 8
						city blocks, yet contains 5 transit stops, 2 of which are
						wheelchair-accessible.

					<a href="outages_heatmap.html" target="_blank">Heatmap of Outages</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This is an interactive Folium heatmap that shows a heatmap of the
					number of outages in each area of Lyon. The data was gathered
					through data scraping of the TCL Itinerary Planner. The heatmap is
					color-coded, with red indicating a high number of outages and green
					indicating a low number of outages. The heatmap is interactive, so
					you can zoom in and out to see more detail. Our data only contains
					outages in the metro system, so only metro lines are shown on the
					map.

					<a href="lyon_stops_distance_all_buildings_heatmap.html" target="_blank">Heatmap of Distance From
						All Buildings to Nearest Transit Stop</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This is an interactive Folium heatmap that shows the distance from
					every building in Lyon to the nearest transit stop. Red means the
					building is farther away from the nearest stop. Purple markers
					represent transit stops. This uses OpenStreetMap's data on
					buildings, so it may not be 100% accurate.

				<h3>
					<a href="lyon_stops_distance_residential_only_heatmap.html" target="_blank">Heatmap of Distance From
						Residential Buildings to Nearest
						Transit</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This is an interactive Folium heatmap that shows a heatmap based on
					the distances from residential buildings to the closest transit
					station (bus, metro, or tram) Red means the building is farther away
					from the nearest station. This uses OpenStreetMap's data on
					residential buildings, so it may not be 100% accurate.
